102
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,058
I told my brother to be
careful about investing.

103
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,995
He wanted to build himself
a nest egg.

Or so they say.

108
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:59,647
Now he's coming back
to share his Midas touch.

109
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,051
My brother taught you
in eighth grade, I believe.

110
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,786
Yep. He was a good man.

111
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,522
He is a good man.

112
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:11,158
But he's a lot poorer today
than he was yesterday.

113
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,597
Now I'm not blaming you
for all of it.

114
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,666
He chose to roll the dice,

115
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,568
nobody made him do it.

116
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,104
But he was led to believe

117
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,873
that the odds were more
in his favor than they were.

118
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,775
- I gave your brother...
- Really?

119
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,610
...and all the investors,

120
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,946
the most up to date information
that's available to me.

121
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,014
You understand that?

122
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,583
So much for the Midas touch.

123
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,852
All right,
what are you accusing me of?

124
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,687
If I'm not accusing you
of anything.

125
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,022
Yeah, well, shit,
you could fooled me.

126
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,790
- Fooling?
- Yeah.

127
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,926

that want to talk to you.

132
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:06,814
And, Russ, I wouldn't
go jaywalking,

133
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:12,787
or speeding at 26 or 27
miles an hour through a 25 zone.

134
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,823
There's been a little

Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir.

Nobody makes it like Delaine.

160

Well, I can't take the credit.

161
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,883
I did get the recipe
from the diner.

162
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,317
You did the cooking though.

Well, I appreciate
you all having me.

Uh, Delaine tells me
you had a rough day today.

166
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,393
Yeah, you could say that.

167
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,795
[Delaine] Oh, yeah.
Cecil Hammett threatened him.

168
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,231

Cecil's an idiot.

- Well--
- But he gets it natural.

170
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,703
His old man was probably
the dumbest person I ever met.

171
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,006
It's a wonder Cecil's
as bright as he is.

- It was still scary.
- Mm.

173
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,911
I hope other folks
took the news better.

174
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,279
You know, a lot of people
don't know this,

175
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,347
but, you know,
I lost a lot of money, as well.

176
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,484
You know,
I'm hurtin' just like, uh,

177
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,419
you know, everybody.
Maybe even more.

178
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,356
And you're sure
Cecil's not a threat?

179
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,793
No way. No.

180
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,228
But, I mean...

181
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,396
But?

182
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:43,337
So, I got a, uh, call today,
sort of threatening.

183
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,206
- I guess.
- Sort of?

184
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:48,742
Hm. I got a call from a fellow
and he asked me,

185
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,079
"Where will you be
the minute you wake up dead?"

186
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,151
- [exhales] That's eerie.
- Mm.

187
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,520
You call the law?

188
00:11:58,553 --> 00:11:59,887
No.

189
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,157
Well, why not?

190
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,426
Well, I just felt like
he's trying to rattle me.

191
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,794
You know?

192
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,230
Russ... [scoffs]

193
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:10,998
Don't mess around with this.

194
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,166
You should call them.

195
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,000
Delaine's right.

196
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,902
You can't be
too careful nowadays,

197
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,538
people are crazy.

198
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,239
Maybe the police
can trace the call.

199
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:21,275
No, I don't think so,
I mean, it came up
as an unknown caller.

200
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,245
You gotta call the sheriff.

201
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:27,881
Anyways, I don't wanna take up
any more your time.

202
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,917
I appreciate the dinner.
Thanks again.

203
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,485
Uh, hey,
let me walk you home.

204
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,053
- Oh, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

205
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,294
[Delaine sighs]

206
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,396
[Russ] I-I thought I'd be
just honest with you--

207
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,400
the stew had just a little
too much salt in it for me.

208
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,104
- [chuckles]
- Nice.

209
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,006
Listen, I wanna
thank you for supper.

210
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,307
- Oh.
- It was delicious.

211
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,509
Any time.

212
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,812
You feel like, uh, coming in?

213
00:12:58,846 --> 00:12:59,913
I'd love to.

214
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:03,384
- [clears throat]
- [Russ] Come on in.

215
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,286
[Delaine] Thank you.

216
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,320
[chuckles]

217
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:09,056
- Can I interest you in beer?
- Yeah, sure.

218
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,491
- I could go for one.
- Nice.

219
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:11,925
- [clears throat]
- [phone ringing]

220
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,060
Yeah, I got them
in the garage.

221
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,028
Let me go grab 'em.

222
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,032
Oh, it's just Pernie.

223
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,334
Hey, Pernie, what's up?

224
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,168
[Pernie on phone]
<i>Sorry to bother, Russ,</i>

225
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,538
<i>Horace's medical report</i>
<i>came back.</i>

226
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:26,373
- Yeah?
<i>- Not looking good</i>
<i>for the poor fella.</i>

227
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,076
- [Russ] Okay.
<i>- Is it okay if I stay</i>
<i>with Horace for a bit?</i>

228
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,446
Pernie, listen, just take
as much time as you want.

229
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,148
- All right?
<i>- Sure.</i>

230
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,550
If you want to take
two, three days off,

231
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,217
that's totally fine. Okay?

232
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,186
<i>I just hate to</i>
<i>leave you right now.</i>

233
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,088
No, I want you just to relax.

234
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,290
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Yep. [chuckles]

235
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:47,494
Pernie, just take care
of Horace. All right?

236
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,196
<i>Thank you, Russ.</i>

237
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,998
- Okay.
<i>- Thank you, thank you.</i>

238
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm sorry, honey.
Good night.

239
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:54,301
<i>I so appreciate it. Bye.</i>

240
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,036
[call hangs up]

241
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,106
Everything all right?

242
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,876
Pernie's, uh, afraid her
husband's cancer came back.

243
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,844
Oh.

244
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,882
Well, speaking of which,

245
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,185
how's your dad doing?

246
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,420
Mm. He's fine.

247
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:14,656
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

248
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,423
Been cancer free
for about a year now.

249
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,425
You know,
I-I wanted to ask him,

250
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,327
but I just kind of
felt odd about it.

251
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,530
You can ask him, he don't mind.

252
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:25,032
There's something
that I'm curious about.

253
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,434
What's that?

254
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:29,870
Why haven't you been married?

255
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,307
[chuckles]

256
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,377
So you feel odd
asking about my daddy's health,

257
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,113
but you're just fine
asking my love life?

258
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,317
Uh, well, uh, hm...

259
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,054
Let's just say the pickens
in Bare Hollow are kinda slim,

260
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,590
if you hadn't noticed.

261
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,992
So why have you stayed?

262
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:55,329
[exhales]
Daddy, mostly.

263
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,198
Besides, I've been here
my whole life.

264
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,935
I don't know where I'm go
or what I'd do when I got there.

265
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,203
Hm.

266
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,309
You know,
I'm gonna tell you something...

267
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,616
I've had a crush on you
since high school.

268
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,318
- You never let on.
- Mm-mm.

269
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,320
How come?

270
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,222
Well, I mean, you know,

271
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,659
you were kinda part of
the popular crew

272
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,529
and I just-- shit,
I didn't think you were
that interested in me.

273
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:34,401
So... would that be
the reason that you
rented this house?

274
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:36,470
No, no, no, no, no.

275
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,405
So-so the price was right,
obviously.

276
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,007
- Mm-hm.
- As you know,
and then, you know,

277
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,610
I thought, well, you know...
[chuckles]

278
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:45,412
It ain't so bad to be next to
the prettiest girl in town.

279
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,384
Hm.

280
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,006
[phone ringing]

281
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,313
- All right. [mutters]
- You don't--

282
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,687
[phone ringing]

283
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:35,262
- Yeah?
- [man on phone] <i>Where will you</i>
<i>be the minute you wake up dead?</i>

284
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,364
Hey, I want you
to listen to me.

285
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,366
Fuck you.

286
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,467
You hear me?

287
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:42,504
<i>You'll find out.</i>

288
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:43,705
Son of a bitch.

289
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,708
Wait...

290
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:50,277
- Wait, was that the caller?
- Yeah.

291
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,514
Okay, Russ,
you gotta promise me

292
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:55,249
that you'll see Sheriff Fowler
in the morning.

293
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,483
I promise.

294
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,318
- Okay.
- Yeah.

295
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,751
You got any plans
this weekend?

296
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:30,450
I might.

297
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,587
- [door opens]
- [chuckles]

298
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,755
What's going on Tillman?

299
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:35,489
Hey, good morning, Russ.

300
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,257
- Thurmond in?
- Yep.

301
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,425
Thank you.

302
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,164
[knocking]

303
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,065
Yeah.

304
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,270
May I?

305
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:51,204
Yeah.

306
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:55,810
Well, I've been getting
some threatening phone calls

307
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,144
I wanted to talk to you about.

308
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,147
Threatening phone calls.

309
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,115
Shocking.

310
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:04,184
From?

311
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,452
Well, I don't know.

312
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:07,822
[sighs]

313
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:09,591
From more than one person?

314
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:12,426
I mean, it seems like
the same person

315
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,696
How old?

316
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:18,165
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd probably say
he's younger than older.

317
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,634
How many calls?

318
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:21,736
Three so far.

319
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,574
So, what exactly
did he say to you?

320
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,744
Where will you be
the minute you wake up dead?

321
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,278
That's it?

322
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,549
What do you mean, that's it?
Yeah, that's it.

323
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:38,418
- You get a number?
- No, it's coming from
an unknown number.

324
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:43,524
Eh, it's likely somebody
upset with you over the merger.

325
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:46,861
Or the, uh... non-merger.

326
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,599
I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

327
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,235
- Hm.
- I mean, if he wanted to
kill you, you'd be dead by now.

328
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:58,271
You know what, Sheriff,
that's-that's really
comforting.

329
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,743
But what happens
if the calls continue?

330
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,778
- What do you do?
- Ah.

331
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:06,279
They'll probably get tired of it
when they find out

332
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,750
that they can't
get you flustered.

333
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:09,651
So that's it?

334
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:11,184
All I can do.

335
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:11,886
- Yeah.
- For now.

336
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,286
You're right.

337
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:18,860
[door closes]

338
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,667
- Mm.
- There you go.

339
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,701
Thank you.

340
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,268
So, did you go?

341
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,538
To the sheriff?
Yeah, I went.

342
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,339
And?

343
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,510
Delaine, he don't give a shit.
Come on, now.

344
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,645
Well, that's the last time
I'm gonna vote for him.

345
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:39,647
Well,
what are you gonna do?

346
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,481
I don't know, I mean,
I'll probably just

347
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,583
ignore the calls.

348
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:50,190
- Hm.
- More importantly though,
last night was perfect.

349
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,360
I know.

350
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,930
I would love to
hit the rewind switch,
if you know what I mean.

351
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,231
Mm-hm.

352
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,901
Well, I'm working
the supper shift tonight,

353
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,469
but, uh, tomorrow night?

354
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,772
Nah, I can't do it tomorrow,
I'm busy.

355
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:07,642
[chuckles]
You ain't got no plans,
nobody likes you right now.

356
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:08,843
[chuckles]

357
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:09,944
All right, I'll be there.

358
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,913
- All right, then.
- Mm-hm.

359
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:20,420
[typing]

360
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:24,391
[phone ringing]

361
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:30,464
This is Russ Potter here.

362
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:33,935
[man on phone] <i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

363
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:37,471
Listen to me,
if you're trying to scare me,
it's not working.

364
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,473
You hear me? It's not working.

365
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,678
[crickets chirping]

366
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,482
<i>Go!</i>

367
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,456
[TV shuts off]

368
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:57,018
[tense music playing]

369
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,509
[gunshots]

370
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:25,445
[indistinct radio chatter]

371
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,852
[dramatic music playing]

372
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,473
[crying]

373
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,044
Delaine, honey.

374
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:59,914
I'm sorry.
I just heard, I'm sorry.

375
00:22:59,947 --> 00:23:03,584
[crying]
I don't understand it.
Who'd wanna kill Daddy?

376
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,620
Okay, let's go inside.
Come on.

377
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,957
- [muttering]
- [crying]

378
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:19,600
I know this is difficult,
but I have to ask
some questions.

379
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,169
When did you find your daddy?

380
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:26,874
Uh, after I come home

381
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,543
from the breakfast shift
at the diner.

382
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:30,878
What time was that?

383
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,715
Around ten o'clock.

384
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:36,150
Thurmond, can't this wait?

385
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,819
No. No, it cannot.

386
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,191
According to the coroner,

387
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,994
Carl was killed
sometime before midnight.

388
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:51,565
When did you last see him?

389
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,135
Uh, just before I left
for the supper shift.

390
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,671
Did your daddy have any enemies?

391
00:23:56,704 --> 00:24:01,742
Anybody he had recently
had a quarrel or...
a disagreement with?

392
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:05,046
- No.
- Did he owe money to anybody?

393
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,948
No.

394
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,516
Anything missing?

395
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,085
Not that I know of.

396
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:16,691
Don't understand.
Somebody wanted
your father dead.

397
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:19,860
- [Russ] Thurmond.
- What?

398
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,896
What if Carl wasn't the target?

399
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,496
What do you mean?

400
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:26,534
Well, I've been telling you
that I've been getting
threatening phone calls, right?

401
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:27,668
So?

402
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:29,870
Well, maybe I was the target.

403
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:32,506
- You? How?
- Yeah.

404
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,875
I mean, it could've been wrong.
Shit, I live right next door.

405
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,978
- Wrong house?
- Mm-hm.

406
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,014
Well, I suppose it's possible,

407
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:43,884
but I would think
that anybody who
wanted to kill you

408
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:44,919
would know where you live.

409
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:47,755
It's a small town.

410
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,792
Who lost the most?

411
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:53,561
I mean,
I don't know that off hand,

412
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:57,631
I would have to check but...
I mean, people lost...

413
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:59,700
thousands and thousands
of dollars.

414
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:03,637
Might be.

415
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:08,776
I heard of it happening
a few years back
down in Jones County.

416
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:14,015
A man hired a hit man
to kill his wife's lover,
but gave him the wrong address.

417
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:16,784
Wound up splitting the throat
of a local preacher.

418
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:20,654
- It's all your fault, Thurmond.
- Hm?

419
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:24,191
If you had just listened to Russ
when he come you,

420
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,027
my daddy might not be dead.

421
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,662
Come on, now.
We don't know what happened.

422
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,765
Let's not go pointing fingers
just yet.

423
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:36,670
Russ, I'm gonna need the names,
phone numbers and addresses

424
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:39,607
of all the people
who lost money.

425
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,776
I'll get it to you
tomorrow morning.

426
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,811
Ah, it's gonna take some time.

427
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:49,984
Ah, again,
I'm-I'm sorry for your loss.

428
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,886
But we'll find out
who did this.

429
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,220
I promise you.

430
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:54,889
Yeah, well, I hold you to that.

431
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:55,990
Please do.

432
00:25:57,358 --> 00:25:59,560
I'll get back to you
when I know more.

433
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:05,900
Delaine.

434
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,269
Mm.

435
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,173
Hey, what can I do for you?

436
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:13,974
Can I just
stay with you for a while?

437
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:16,010
Of course.

438
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:19,747
'Cause I can't stand
the thought of being here
with Dad gone.

439
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,016
Of course.
Stay as long as you want.

440
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,250
Hey, come here.

441
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,752
[crying]

442
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:30,057
Can't believe
somebody's so mad at you,
they'd want to kill you.

443
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,659
Mm-hm.

444
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:33,828
Well, it can be
a wicked world, can't it?

445
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:34,862
Hm.

446
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,364
Are you still religious?

447
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,701
No.

448
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:43,070
Why not?

449
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:46,407
I've rode the-the devil's back
way too many times.

450
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,144
I might burn up if I walk into
a church at this point.
[chuckles]

451
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:52,313
Is that why you come home?

452
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,914
Yeah. I mean,
I needed to plug in.

453
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,149
I mean, why not here at home?

454
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,183
Hm.

455
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,925
You're still going to church.

456
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:08,262
My mama was strict about it,
but...

457
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:13,400
after she died
from taking ammonia
we never went back.

458
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:16,137
- Hm.
- Daddy blamed God
for taking her from him.

459
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,639
Just... couldn't forgive Him.

460
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:26,080
You know what I've never
understood about religion?

461
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:27,848
What?

462
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,884
Well, are we sinners
because we sin,

463
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:33,821
or do we sin
because we're born sinners?

464
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:39,960
And if it's the latter,
then what right
does God have to judge us?

465
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:41,028
Hm?

466
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:45,466
If you ever figure it out,
let me know.

467
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,168
[soft chuckle]

468
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:03,117
I got all the information
that you asked for:

469
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,120
names, addresses,
phone numbers,

470
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:07,821
and exactly
what they invested.

471
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,390
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

472
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,367
I'm sorry for not taking you
more seriously about
these phone calls.

473
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:22,069
Mm.

474
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,204
You got anymore?

475
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,906
No, no,
not since Carl was killed.

476
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:30,512
You really think
it's the wrong house?

477
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:32,846
And you knew Carl pretty well,
didn't you?

478
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,050
No, I mean, I moved in
two months ago
and met him there.

479
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:39,053
Ever see any
suspicious people over?

480
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,956
No. I mean, he didn't seem like
the kinda person
that got in trouble.

481
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:44,258
I mean, if you ask me,
he was a gentle soul.

482
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,361
So, wrong house is still
the best theory then.

483
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:49,797
Yeah.

484
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,465
Let me know if you
need anything else.

485
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,300
Uh, Russ.

486
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,135
Be careful.

487
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:57,771
Any of this theory is correct,

488
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:59,406
this guy may not be done.

489
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:09,416
[clears throat]

490
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:30,204
- Hey.
- Hey.

491
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:31,805
What are you doing?

492
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,810
I'm, uh, getting rid of
some of Daddy's things.

493
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,413
I thought you weren't ready
to go back in the house yet.

494
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:42,483
I'm not, really.

495
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:46,186
Just didn't want to
put it off for too long.

496
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,524
What about these?
Where do you want 'em?

497
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:51,859
You can set him right there.
I'll get him in a sec.

498
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,227
Thanks.

499
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,899
- Who's that Delaine?
- That's Lucius.

500
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:01,468
You might have seen him work in
the kitchen at the diner.

501
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:03,003
No, no.

502
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:05,339
Well, I thought he could use
a little extra money,

503
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:07,509
so I asked him to help me
pack up the house.

504
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,844
So you're moving, huh?
That's it.

505
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,380
Yeah.

506
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:16,050
Yeah, I'm gonna sell it.

507
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,219
I can't live here no more
after what happened.

508
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:21,589
- You understand.
- Of course, yeah.

509
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:24,992
Just, uh...
seems a bit sudden is all.

510
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:27,294
I know.

511
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,197
It's not like I'm-I'm moving
today or tomorrow.

512
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,300
Right.
Yeah, all right.

513
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:36,103
Well, shit, let me know
if you need anything.

514
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:39,574
- Ru-- Hey, Russ.
- I think I may have lost
one of my gold hoop earrings

515
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,942
at your house,
so if you come across it,
let me know.

516
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:45,979
Daddy gave them to me, so...

517
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,247
All right, will do.

518
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:54,988
[door closes]

519
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,327
Hey.

520
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,995
You shouldn't have come out
when he was there,

521
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,897
he might have
recognized your voice.

522
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,933
I didn't know he was there
until I stepped out.

523
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,435
Hey, you said
he wouldn't be home.

524
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:10,070
He wasn't supposed to be.

525
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:12,339
Well, now my fault then.

526
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:14,942
- When do I get my money?
- Soon enough.

527
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:17,111
- Well, when?
- When the check comes in.

528
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,581
We have been through this.
Relax.

529
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,215
Yeah, easy for you to say.

530
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:23,150
I owe people money.
I told you that.

531
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:25,587
And they won't wait,
so I can't wait.

532
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,555
It's just a few more days.

533
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:28,590
Hey.

534
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:34,662
Hm.

535
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:36,631
Money will be here any day now.

536
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:39,099
You'll see.

537
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,702
- Well, it better be.
- Mm-hm.

538
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,570
[knocking on door]

539
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:44,706
Shit!

540
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:47,374
- [door opens]
- I found your earring.

541
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,110
Where on Earth did you find it?

542
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:52,045
Under the couch.
Soon as you walk in.

543
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,016
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

544
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,552
I gotta get back to the office.

545
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:58,986
I'll see you soon.

546
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,220
Okay. Bye.

547
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,491
[Thurmond]
Did you threaten Russ Potter?

548
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:07,961
Well...
[soft chuckle]

549
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:09,196
Well, what?

550
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,299
Sorta, yeah.

551
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,968
But not really.

552
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:18,005
Well, which is it?
You did, or you didn't?

553
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,274
Well, I did.

554
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:22,209
But-but I didn't mean it.

555
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,646
I mean, I-I meant it at the time
but-but not now.

556
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,013
I wouldn't hurt nobody.

557
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:27,582
How much did you invest?

558
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,452
Oh, well, I--
I'd rather not say.

559
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,320
Ten-thousand
sound about right?

560
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,290
Oh, gosh all mighty, darn.

561
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,192
If you knew then why'd you ask?

562
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:41,061
Awful lot of money to lose.

563
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:42,630
You sure you didn't mean it?

564
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:45,265
No. Oh, no.

565
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,367
Like I said,
I meant it at the time.

566
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,671
I was mad.
Hell, I was more than mad.

567
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:50,605
I wanted to hurt him.

568
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,609
- But now...
- Now what?

569
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:58,546
I decided to forgive Russ.

570
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,314
It's the Christian thing to do.

571
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:03,651
- Let me ask you a question.
- Shoot.

572
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:06,253
Where will you be
the minute to wake up dead?

573
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,323
Pardon?

574
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:13,227
Where will you be,
the minute you wake up dead?

575
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,063
I don't understand.

576
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:21,468
No, I don't think you do, Cecil.

577
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,538
All right. You can go.

578
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:26,508
What kind of question is that?

579
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,476
I said you can go, Cecil.
Bye.

580
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,179
Fine.

581
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:33,447
You ask crazy questions.

582
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,282
I'll just carry my ass
outta here.

583
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,124
And the insurance company
you wanted,

584
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:45,325
it's on line one.

585
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:02,409
[engine stops]

586
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,452
Evening, Lucius.

587
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:16,791
- Look, I know I'm behind.
- Yeah, you're way behind.

588
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:19,794
But I'm about to
come into a lot of money.

589
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:23,230
- You know, I just need--
- I just need you

590
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,532
to give me my money.

591
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,601
Look, and you're gonna get it.

592
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:27,802
[chuckles]

593
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,369
But that's what you
said last week.

594
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:31,405
Oh, but I did a job.

595
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,141
It's gonna pay everything.

596
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:36,476
What kind of job did you do,

597
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:39,514
that's gonna pay you 5k?

598
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:40,748
I killed a man.

599
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:41,816
[laughs]

600
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,520
- You killed a man?
- Yeah.

601
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:47,622
Who'd you kill, Lucius?

602
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:49,222
Carl Moore.

603
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:52,527
Oh, anyhow.

604
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,397
Yeah, I work with his daughter
Delaine at the diner.

605
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:03,337
And she wanted him killed
to collect a shit load
of insurance money.

606
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,273
- So, I just need--
- I just need!

607
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:08,610
I mean, there you go again
with the I just needs.

608
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:10,377
And so what I need you to know,

609
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,715
is I just need
my motherfucking money.

610
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,449
Just a couple more days.

611
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:16,684
Just a couple more days.

612
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,485
- [groaning]
- Couple more days!

613
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,623
Just a couple more days!

614
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:23,558
You sound like
a 12-year-old child!

615
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,760
- I swear!
- Oh, you swear, huh?

616
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:28,830
Really shouldn't swear.

617
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:30,497
Says so in the bible.

618
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,900
You know what else
is in the bible?

619
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:36,838
He who beareth false witness,

620
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,906
that man shall perish.

621
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,474
Yeah, faith in youth.

622
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:42,910
Mace.

623
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:47,949
Hey-- [mutters]
Jody!

624
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:50,183
- There's no need!
- Mace!

625
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:51,385
What are you doing?

626
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,921
Man's a fry cook.

627
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:56,824
He needs his hands
to make a living!

628
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:58,358
Use your brain!

629
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:01,261
How's he supposed to pay us,
if he ain't got no hands?

630
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,331
Take off your shoe.

631
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:07,367
Take off your shoe.

632
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:10,605
- Jody, please.
- Take off your shoe
and your goddamn sock.

633
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:12,439
Take off your shoe!

634
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,207
Jody, no, please!

635
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,309
Come on, now!

636
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:18,579
Guys, we're all friends here!

637
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,247
Oh...

638
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,719
[muttering]

639
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,254
[chuckles]

640
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:28,255
Stay still.

641
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,257
[whimpers]

642
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,294
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
not the pinky toe.

643
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,998
Pink toe's important.

644
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:39,366
Next to the big toe
it's probably
the most important.

645
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,802
You need it for balance.

646
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:43,336
Now that third and fourth toe,

647
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,806
they ain't so important.

648
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,607
Well, which one?

649
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:48,009
Three or four?

650
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:52,513
You know what,
I'm feeling sporting.

651
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:54,414
Why don't you pick, Lucius.

652
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,683
What?

653
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,953
No, no, I can't pick.

654
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,723
Well, you're gonna pick,
or we're gonna take them both.

655
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:04,625
Fourth.

656
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,561
Why'd you pick four?

657
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:07,695
It's smaller.

658
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,297
So it is.

659
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,000
Don't do this.

660
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,374
- [grunts]
- [screaming]

661
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,310
[Mace laughs]

662
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:25,345
[yelling]

663
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:28,583
Oh, my toe!

664
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:33,588
Ah, you gonna give me
my money by tomorrow.

665
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:34,856
Or you're gonna have
matching feet.

666
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:37,290
[yelling]

667
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:44,999
[yelling continues]

668
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:46,968
...took my toe!

669
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,077
[Lucius] Look, I ain't foolin'!
I just got my toe cut off!

670
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,446
- What?
- With a bolt cutter!

671
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:02,016
Now give me some damn money!

672
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:06,053
Okay. Okay.
I'll get you some money.

673
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:07,287
Okay?

674
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:10,892
[groaning]

675
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:13,561
Okay, here, here.

676
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:15,029
Now that's all I got.

677
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:16,496
What is this?

678
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:19,934
One... three...
20... 40...

679
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,602
Sixty-three dollars!

680
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:24,806
I told you,
that's all I got.

681
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,473
Tips were short tonight.

682
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:29,409
Well, then go to an ATM.

683
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:32,680
[chuckles] I don't got
nothing in the bank.

684
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:36,884
Oh, you owe me five grand.

685
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:38,485
And you'll get it.

686
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,622
I'm broke, too. Why do you think
I'm doing all this, huh?

687
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,390
I need the money
just as bad as you do.

688
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:45,392
I doubt that!

689
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,795
You still got all your toes.

690
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:51,398
Now, you need to give me
some serious money or I'll--

691
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,568
Or you'll what? Hm?

692
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:56,469
You're the murderer here.

693
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:59,106
Well, I'll do you
what I did to your daddy.

694
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,042
Oh, are you threatening me?

695
00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:03,978
Now, how would you
get your money then, genius?

696
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:04,879
Soon!

697
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:12,553
[Thurmond] <i>What can you tell me</i>
<i>about Lucius McFalls?</i>

698
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:13,521
Your cook.

699
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:18,391
Well, he seems like
a decent enough guy.

700
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:19,627
Good cook.

701
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,097
Well, not great
but good enough.

702
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,733
He gets a little hot-headed
every now and then,

703
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:28,669
but other than that
I got no complaints.

704
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:29,770
Is he in trouble?

705
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:31,438
[Thurmond] Not sure yet.

706
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,441
What about Delaine?

707
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:35,810
She cause you any trouble?

708
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:37,979
She is a good waitress.

709
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:40,447
Real personable,
people like her,

710
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,149
especially with men...
[chuckles]

711
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:43,751
...she's a little flirty.

712
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:45,786
But she's a hard worker.

713
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,823
She been doing a lot
of extra shifts lately.

714
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:51,125
Why?

715
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:55,096
Because she owes me some money.

716
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:57,798
Why?

717
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:00,167
Oh, come on, Thurmond.

718
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,637
You know, I don't like to
speak ill of the dead,

719
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,674
but her and her old man, they...
they liked to gamble,

720
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:08,843
mostly on the internet,
I think.

721
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:10,945
[door opens]

722
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,149
She and Lucius friends?

723
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,685
I see 'em talking
from time to time,

724
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:20,187
but she talks to everybody.

725
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:22,089
What's this all about, Thurmond?

726
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:26,560
I wish I knew, Dewey.

727
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:30,965
I wish I knew.

728
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:40,975
Can I have a piece
of cherry pie to go?

729
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:57,992
[tense music playing]

730
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:28,155

[siren chirps]

733
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:52,179
License and registration,
please.

734
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,049
I wasn't doin' nothing.

735
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:56,917
License and registration.

736
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:03,090
What did I do?

737
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:05,226
You were blocking
two parking spaces.

738
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,227
Huh?

739
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,329
Were straddling the line.

740
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:11,632
There's a town ordinance
against that.

741
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:13,334
There's no one in the lot.

742
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,302
Law's the law, son.

743
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:16,837
It's called a gateway crime.

744
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:19,573
You got to be shittin', me, man.

745
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:21,876
Sorry, sir.

746
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:26,814
You ever get over to
the west part of town?

747
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:29,050
Ah, I haven't been over
that way in a while,

748
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:31,285
You know,
probably a month or longer.

749
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:33,154
A month or longer?

750
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,990
- You're sure about that?
- Mm-hm.

751
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:40,361
Don't go over there
to see Delaine Moore, maybe?

752
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,763
I wouldn't blame you
if you did.

753
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:44,765
Mighty good looking woman?

754
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:48,069
Hell, if I was younger,
I'd try to see her myself.

755
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:51,305
I work with her.
And that's it.

756
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:54,708
Hm. Then you're dumber
than I thought.

757
00:42:57,278 --> 00:42:58,612
Are we done?

758
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:00,815
For now.

759
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,918
Take this is as a warning.

760
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:05,886
Next time I write you a ticket.

761
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:12,059

[Lucius]
<i>Where will you be</i>

765
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,809
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

766
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:05,746
Lucius.
Lucius, that ain't funny.

767
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:08,048
<i>You'll soon find out.</i>

768
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,216

Hey, sweetheart.

773
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,270
Hey, Russ.

774
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:30,471
Yeah, what's going on?

775
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,106
Um... [clears throat]

776
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:34,742
Could I maybe
stay at your place tonight,

777
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:37,111
or well, for a couple of nights?

778
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:40,247
Delaine, I've told you before,
you can stay
as long as you want.

779
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:42,049
Thank you.

780
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:44,118
You're good man,
Charlie Brown.

781
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:45,786
I look forward to it.
See you tonight.

782
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:47,254
Okay.

783
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:55,362
[dramatic music playing]

[phone ringing]

785
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:07,775
You gonna get that, Delaine?

786
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:10,778
Mm. No.

787
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:13,414
It's probably just somebody
trying to sell me something.

788
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,916
Been gettin' a lot
of them calls lately.

789
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,351
Ah, it could be the sheriff.

790
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,820
Might have some news
about the investigation.

791
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:23,257
Fine.

792
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,459
- [clears throat]
- [phone continues ringing]

793
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:30,397
Hello.

794
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:31,498
[Lucius] <i>Where will you be</i>

<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

796
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,969
Sorry, I'm not interested.

797
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:37,805
So, please don't call
this number no more.

798
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:41,342
Mm, that's annoying.

799
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,043
Maybe you ought to
block the caller.

800
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:44,845
Good idea.

801
00:45:51,185 --> 00:45:52,353
[door opens]

802
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:53,787
I got your money.

803
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:56,457
About time.

804
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,459
No, it's too risky
to give it to you here.

805
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,828
Oh, so I'll come
to your place later.

806
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:02,129
No, Russ might see you.

807
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,932
We got to meet somewhere else.

808
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:07,301
How about I come
to your place tonight?

809
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:08,302
Fine with me.

810
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:11,972
I can bring us some wine.
We can celebrate.

811
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:13,274
You got all of it?

812
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,943
Oh, you'll get
everything that's coming to you.

813
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:17,344
I promise.

814
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:18,812
Honest to God.

815
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:20,948
[foreboding music playing]

816
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:02,222
[Delaine sighs]

817
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:06,226
Knock, knock.

818
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,629
Well, hi, over there.

819
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:12,232
I, uh, love what you've, uh,
done with your place.

820
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:17,071
[sighs]

821
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:19,473
Brought the wine,
as promised.

822
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:21,442
You'd better have
more than wine in there.

823
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:22,910
Oh, I do.

824
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:27,414
I ain't got no wine glasses.

825
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,383
Well, I didn't expect you did,

826
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:32,986
so...voilà.

827
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,155
I told you, I ain't
much of a wine drinker.

828
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,424
Look, I'll just have a beer.

829
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,026
I think you're gonna like this.

830
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,361
It's French.

831
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:44,264
And I've been saving it
for a very special occasion.

832
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:47,167
- Hm.
- Come on, just try it.

833
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,969
Might find yourself surprised.

834
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:56,176
To us, to a perfect plan
and getting rich.

835
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:00,180
Hm.

836
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:01,248
You first.

837
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,017
What, you don't trust me?

838
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,919
Mm-mm.
Why would I?

839
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,288
[sighs]

840
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:11,992
Mmm.

841
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:15,396
Satisfied?

842
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:22,604
Ain't it good?

843
00:48:22,637 --> 00:48:24,672
Eh, it's a little sour.

844
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:27,107
Lucius, you gotta
broaden your horizons.

845
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:29,243
You're about to become
a very rich man.

846
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:32,279
No, not after I pay out
all the money I owe.

847
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:36,383
Well, I think you
should keep some of the money
for yourself and enjoy it.

848
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,185
- Treat yourself to some...
- [burps]

849
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:41,488
...imported beer
or some good whiskey or bourbon.

850
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:46,260
Just give me the money.

851
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:48,295
Patience is a virtue, you know.

852
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,532
Mm-hm.

853
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:52,534
Mm.

854
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:57,572
Yeah.

855
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:59,674
[Lucius choking]

856
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:01,709
It's all gonna be all right.

857
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:07,448
Gonna be over soon.

858
00:49:08,415 --> 00:49:10,250
[chokes] How?

859
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:14,421
Well, poison was in the glass
before I poured the wine.

860
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:17,224
It's amazing what you can learn
on the internet.

861
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:18,693
Why?

862
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,730
Well, if you
had just been patient,

863
00:49:22,764 --> 00:49:24,599
none of this
would have been necessary.

864
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:27,635
'Cause everything
was going so well.

865
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:32,406
But then you had to go
and make those phone calls
and threaten me.

866
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,509
Calls?

867
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,443
[coughs] I didn't...

868
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:38,378
I didn't, I swear.

869
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:41,114
Now you only have
yourself to blame, Lucius.

870
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,551
Look at it this way.

871
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:48,723
You're about to uncover
the great enduring mystery.

872
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:53,728
You're gonna find out
where we're all gonna be
when we wake up dead.

873
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:57,097
Well, at least
us sinners anyway.

874
00:49:57,765 --> 00:50:00,033
[choking]

875
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,069
Mm.

876
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:04,739
It's so good.

877
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:37,170
[indistinct]
You seen Lucius?

878
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:38,706
Jada, Lucius?

879
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,140
Anybody seen Lucius?

880
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:42,175
We open in ten minutes.

881
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:45,078
- Hey, you seen Lucius?
- No. He ain't here yet?

882
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:47,247
Well, no he ain't here yet.
And that ain't like him.

883
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:49,483
- All right, well,
you try calling him?
- Yeah, I tried to call him,

884
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:52,452
- but he didn't answer.
- Well, maybe he's
just running late.

885
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:53,621
He'll probably be here soon.

886
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:55,757
Yeah, well, he better.

887
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,492
[phone ringing]

888
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:07,669
[Lucius] <i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

889
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:09,069
Lucius?

890
00:51:12,205 --> 00:51:13,608
[phone beeps off]

891
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:14,809
- [Dewey] Hey...
- [knocks on counter]

892
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:15,877
Let's get a move on.

893
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,110
We gotta open.

894
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:19,146
Uh, Dewey, uh,

895
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:21,481
I'm not feeling so good.
I'm sorry. I gotta go home.

896
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:23,450
Hey, you can't go.

897
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:24,686
I already ain't got no cook!

898
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,353
And Penny called,
said she's gonna be late.

899
00:51:26,386 --> 00:51:29,122
I'm sorry, I have to go.

900
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:30,424
Delaine--

901
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:32,760
You better be back
for the lunch shift.

902
00:51:32,794 --> 00:51:35,228
[tense music playing]

903
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,638
Lucius...

904
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:52,647
[tense music continues]

905
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:06,393
[line trilling]

906
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,295
Answer.

907
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,632
- [Russ] <i>Hello.</i>
- Russ.

908
00:52:10,665 --> 00:52:13,200
- <i>Hey there.</i>
- Hey, uh, hey, listen,

909
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,669
I'm just-- I'm just calling
to let you know

910
00:52:14,702 --> 00:52:15,937
I'm going to stay at your house
again tonight,

911
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,171
- if that's all right.
- <i>You know it is.</i>

912
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,775
- <i>You okay?</i>
- No.

913
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:21,943
<i>What's wrong?</i>

914
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:23,544
[stutters] I'll tell you

915
00:52:23,578 --> 00:52:26,781
when I get home from my shift,
okay, just please be there.

916
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:27,915
<i>No problem.</i>

917
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:29,784
- Bye.
- [phone beeps off]

918
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:32,219
[vehicle approaching]

919
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:33,688
[tires screeching]

920
00:52:38,993 --> 00:52:40,360
[door closes]

921
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:47,267
[door opens]

922
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:49,637
Get out of my car.

923
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:51,639
Who are you?

924
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:53,775
Easy now, wildcat.

925
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:56,276
We're friends of Lucius.

926
00:52:57,512 --> 00:52:59,580
Or rather we was.

927
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:00,782
What do you mean?

928
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:03,851
Seems our friend Lucius is dead,

929
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:05,285
which is a shame.

930
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:07,622
'Cause he owed me
a shit load of money.

931
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,224
But silver lining,

932
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:13,895
you just came into a shit load.

933
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:17,632
So seeing as Lucius is dead
and you're the one
who killed him,

934
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:19,534
his debt rolls over to you.

935
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:24,404
I didn't kill Lucius.

936
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:27,441
He's alive.
He just called me.

937
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:29,677
[laughing]

938
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:30,878
Yeah, well, I doubt that,

939
00:53:30,912 --> 00:53:32,412
'cause we just seen him.

940
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:35,248
He's dead as a doornail.

941
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:37,284
- But--
- But, but, but, but, but...

942
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:40,253
Save your buts, Princess.

943
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:42,790
We saw you driving away.
How you think we found you?

944
00:53:44,324 --> 00:53:45,425
How much you gettin'?

945
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:51,032
Fifty thousand.

946
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:54,267
Fifty thousand dollars.

947
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:56,771
Well, Lucius, he owed me ten.

948
00:53:56,804 --> 00:54:00,373
What, with interest and all,
carry the one divided by two...

949
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:02,275
20k should do it.

950
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,645
Twenty thousand?

951
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:05,947
By tomorrow.

952
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,549
[chuckles]
That's impossible.

953
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:09,851
[knife unsheathes]

954
00:54:09,884 --> 00:54:13,921
See, Mace, the wicked
are stubborn and selfish.

955
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:15,455
Do your thing.

956
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,492
- No, no, no--
- Mace!

957
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,528
What are you doing?

958
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:23,396
She's a waitress, dummy.

959
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,966
She's on her feet
all day long.

960
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:27,034
You cut off her toe,
she's going be hobbling around

961
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:28,770
like a three-legged dog.

962
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:33,641
You right or left-handed?

963
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:35,576
None of your damn business.

964
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,412
Well, it's a known fact
that 90 percent of human beings

965
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,682
are right-handed, so...

966
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,951
No! No, no, no, no!

967
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:44,819
Please, please, please.

968
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:46,319
No, no, no!

969
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:48,321
Please, please, stop--
I have the money.

970
00:54:48,355 --> 00:54:50,591
I'll get you the money.
Stop, please. Stop him!

971
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,026
Okay, all right.

972
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:57,064
I'm not a man completely
devoid of compassion.

973
00:54:57,098 --> 00:54:59,499
[inhales]
You can keep your finger.

974
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:00,433
For now.

975
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:03,771
But if I don't get my money
in two days,

976
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:07,108
that little piggy right there,
it's gonna go "Wee, wee, wee,"

977
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:09,076
all the way to the butcher shop.

978
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:15,315
Time's up.

979
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:25,893
[phone beeps]

980
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:27,628
This is Russ.

981
00:55:27,662 --> 00:55:29,664
What you doing for supper?

982
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,098
I don't have any plans.

983
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:33,067
Why don't you
come out to the house?

984
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,102
I'll throw a couple of steaks
on the grill.

985
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,605
Thurmond, is there something
you want to talk to me about?

986
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:41,943
I got some information
you might be interested in.

987
00:55:41,976 --> 00:55:45,546
And I haven't been the kindest
person to you lately.

988
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,714
Okay, what time?

989
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:49,550
I eat early. Five?

990
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:50,651
Okay.

991
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:52,820
I'll be there.

992
00:55:58,826 --> 00:55:59,727
[knocking on door]

993
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:04,031
Come in.

994
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,136
I just came by
to pick up a few things.

995
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,806
Well, shit, come in and sit down
and we'll have a drink.

996
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,875
- [chuckles]
- Come on.

997
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:20,948
How is, uh, Horace doing?

998
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:23,551
- He is hanging in.
- Yeah?

999
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:26,554
Just the medical bills
that are killing us.

1000
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:30,423
[Russ] Well, I want to know that
I've been thinking about you.

1001
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:32,492
And I'm gonna come up
with something, okay.

1002
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:34,461
Oh, I appreciate that.

1003
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,864
Shit.

1004
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,168
Cheers.

1005
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,704
[chuckles]

1006
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,506
It was a damn good steak,
Thurmond.

1007
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:50,144
- Not much of a cook.
- Mm.

1008
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:52,780
But I can grill
with the best of 'em.

1009
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:54,548
So how long have you
been here now?

1010
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:57,118
Um, going on seven years.

1011
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,452
Oh.

1012
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:03,157
After my wife died,
I decided to build
my dream home.

1013
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,893
I don't know why the hell
I waited so long.

1014
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,663
What about you?

1015
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:10,932
How come you never married?

1016
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:12,700
Shit, I got close once.

1017
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:13,801
What about Delaine?

1018
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:15,903
I mean, she's fine.
We're friends.

1019
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:19,472
And you're telling me
that you two never...

1020
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:21,776
I mean,
being neighbors and all.

1021
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:22,877
We're not that neighborly.

1022
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,845
Okay, okay.

1023
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:26,814
Excuse me for prying.

1024
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:29,951
Just habit of the job.

1025
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:33,054
So what's the, uh, information
you wanted to talk to me about?

1026
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:34,055
Oh, yeah.

1027
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:37,658
Take a look at this.

1028
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:39,827
[Russ clears throat]

1029
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:44,732
Lucius McFalls.

1030
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:45,866
Bad dude.

1031
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:47,802
You know that guy?

1032
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:50,571
No, I don't know him,

1033
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:51,706
but I saw him the other day.

1034
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:53,808
Where?

1035
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:55,543
Over at Delaine's house,

1036
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:58,145
he was helping her
move her Daddy's shit out.

1037
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:00,548
I mean, he's got
a hell of a rap sheet.

1038
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,482
- Well--
- Petty stuff, but...

1039
00:58:03,718 --> 00:58:05,820
still, it's just
not the kind of person

1040
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:07,989
I would think Delaine
would be hanging around.

1041
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:09,857
Well, obviously, I'll tell her.

1042
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,094
No, don't... tell her about it.

1043
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:13,995
Why not?

1044
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,497
Well, I shouldn't be
telling you this, but...

1045
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:21,669
What the hell, I think
you have a right to know.

1046
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:25,206
You're being used.

1047
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:29,844
Whenever there's a murder,
we ask,

1048
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,812
"Who stands to gain from it?"

1049
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:34,815
Who stands to gain
from Carl's death?

1050
00:58:36,217 --> 00:58:37,918
I don't know.

1051
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:39,854
Delaine, of course.

1052
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:42,156
Why?

1053
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,858
Life insurance.

1054
00:58:45,693 --> 00:58:50,197
Delaine stands to get
over $500,000.

1055
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:55,336
So... I don't--
I'm not following.

1056
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:56,871
What are you saying, Thurmond?

1057
00:58:58,272 --> 00:59:00,641
I'm saying I believe

1058
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:04,245
that Delaine and hired Lucius
to kill Carl,

1059
00:59:04,278 --> 00:59:07,048
make it look like you were
the original target.

1060
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:10,117
The old wrong house,
wrong victim thing.

1061
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:12,286
Yeah, that's-that's crazy.

1062
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,654
I'm the one that brought it up.

1063
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:17,291
Played right into their hands.

1064
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:19,693
I bet Lucius
is the one calling you.

1065
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:22,329
Hm.

1066
00:59:24,131 --> 00:59:28,636
Lucius was seen
driving on your street at 10:13.

1067
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,305
It puts him right there.

1068
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:32,973
Some shit.

1069
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:35,810
To top it off,

1070
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:38,345
Delaine and Carl
are in a shit load of debt.

1071
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:41,082
Online betting.

1072
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:45,086
They were about to
lose the house.

1073
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,289
So she's been
borrowing money from Dewey

1074
00:59:48,322 --> 00:59:51,225
and then working extra shifts
to pay him off.

1075
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,761
Thurmond, who else
knows about this?

1076
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:55,262
Nobody.

1077
00:59:55,296 --> 00:59:58,199
Like I told you,
I shouldn't be telling you.

1078
00:59:58,232 --> 01:00:01,735
But I wanted to confirm
a couple of things.

1079
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:05,940
And I... I think you
have a right to know.

1080
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:07,308
Well, I appreciate it.

1081
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:09,076
I really do.
Thank you.

1082
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:12,113
Now, not a word to Delaine.
Okay?

1083
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:14,882
Not a word.
I promise.

1084
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:20,321
[dramatic music playing]

1085
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,968

[tense music playing]

1087
01:01:49,476 --> 01:01:51,011
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1088
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:55,883
- [sighs]
- You okay?

1089
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:58,385
Yeah, I'm just glad you're home.

1090
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:05,025
I'm here now.

1091
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,228
What's going on?

1092
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:13,867
Russ, I can't thank you enough
for how you've taken care of me
since Daddy died.

1093
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,336
Well, listen,
I'm happy to help.

1094
01:02:17,171 --> 01:02:18,739
I would've done
anything for you.

1095
01:02:20,207 --> 01:02:22,910
Okay, Russ, there's something
I gotta tell you.

1096
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:25,012
Okay, I'm listening.

1097
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:30,851
I just... I don't know
how you're going to take this.

1098
01:02:32,386 --> 01:02:35,523
I think I could
use a beer first.

1099
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:38,125
Cool, you know where
the fridge is, right?

1100
01:02:38,158 --> 01:02:40,361
- Grab me one, too,
while you're at it.
- Okay.

1101
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,102
[tense music playing]

1102
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:59,847

1103

[gasps]

1104
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,018
You get lost?

1105
01:03:38,052 --> 01:03:40,187
[soft chuckle]
[clears throat]

1106
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:47,161
So, there's something
you wanted to tell me.

1107
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:50,331
Tell me about your day first.

1108
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:52,199
I mean, it was good.

1109
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:54,368
I went over to Thurmond's,
we had steaks,

1110
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:57,639
and he updated me
about the investigation, so...

1111
01:03:57,672 --> 01:04:01,408
You? I'm the one
he should be updating.

1112
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:03,578
Well, I think he was
gonna fill you in tomorrow,

1113
01:04:03,611 --> 01:04:06,947
but, uh, he won't be
doing that anymore.

1114
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,415
Why not?

1115
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:11,051
Well, I shot him.

1116
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,488
What?

1117
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:16,957
Yeah, he's dead, Delaine.
I shot him.

1118
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:19,026
Why?

1119
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,562
Old Thurmond
was a little smarter

1120
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:22,162
than I gave him credit for.

1121
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:24,365
He knew everything, Delaine.

1122
01:04:24,398 --> 01:04:27,267
Well, not everything.
I, mean he didn't know that I...

1123
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,203
I knew everything, too.

1124
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:30,904
[Lucius] I owe people money.

1125
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:32,574
And they won't wait,
so I can't wait.

1126
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:34,642
[Delaine]
Look, the insurance company
will pay out

1127
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:37,277
as soon as the sheriff
wraps up his investigation.

1128
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:39,146
The money'll be here any day.

1129
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:43,317
Yeah.

1130
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,952
Aren't I the fool?

1131
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:50,224
And to think that I suggested
the wrong house,

1132
01:04:50,257 --> 01:04:52,359
the wrong victim theory
to Thurmond.

1133
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:55,295
You don't know
the whole story.

1134
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,398
Oh, yeah?

1135
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:00,167
What don't I know, Delaine?

1136
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,168
Tell me.

1137
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:02,236
First, why don't you tell me

1138
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:04,438
what Lucius
is doing in your trunk?

1139
01:05:04,471 --> 01:05:06,273
Well, he's protecting us.

1140
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,610
No body, no crime.

1141
01:05:09,611 --> 01:05:11,646
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

1142
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:15,449
You see, you and I,

1143
01:05:15,482 --> 01:05:18,318
we're going to split
the insurance money.

1144
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:21,155
What people don't understand
is I lost a lot of money

1145
01:05:21,188 --> 01:05:22,724
when the merger
didn't go through.

1146
01:05:22,757 --> 01:05:24,958
I'm about to
lose my business.

1147
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,094
I don't understand.

1148
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:29,329
I was with you

1149
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:31,699
when I got one of them calls
from Lucius.

1150
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:35,068
- Yeah.
- How do you explain that?

1151
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:36,036
Pernie.

1152
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:39,173
Yeah. I gave her the recording.

1153
01:05:40,508 --> 01:05:44,077
And you did exactly
what I thought you would do.

1154
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:46,681
You see, Pernie,
she's broke, too.

1155
01:05:46,714 --> 01:05:48,583
So when I told her
about my little plan,

1156
01:05:48,616 --> 01:05:50,752
she, you know,
was eager to help out

1157
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:54,221
for a...
a small cut, of course.

1158
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,190
[scoffs]

1159
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,158
Lord have mercy.

1160
01:05:58,192 --> 01:06:00,327
So, Delaine,

1161
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,630
once again, what don't I know?

1162
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:07,401
This wasn't my idea.

1163
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:13,373
It was Daddy's, his-his cancer
came back stage four.

1164
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:15,375
So that's why you killed him?

1165
01:06:16,544 --> 01:06:18,111
He was gonna commit suicide,

1166
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:20,782
but then I wouldn't get
any insurance money.

1167
01:06:20,815 --> 01:06:23,250
We're in debt
from his gambling habit.

1168
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:25,018
About to lose the house.

1169
01:06:28,188 --> 01:06:33,695
Russ... I didn't know you then
like I know you now.

1170
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,296
If I did, I never would've
gone through with this.

1171
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:40,668
I never meant you no harm.

1172
01:06:40,702 --> 01:06:43,403
Do you expect me
to believe that shit?

1173
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:47,307
It's the God to honest truth.

1174
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,077
Delaine, you killed your--

1175
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:53,280
[tense music playing]

1176
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:55,182
We could have made
a go of this.

1177
01:06:55,215 --> 01:06:58,218
I was falling in love
with you, Russ.

1178
01:06:58,252 --> 01:07:00,722
I really was.

1179
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:02,790
If you woulda only
minded your own business.

1180
01:07:03,858 --> 01:07:06,260
But money is money.

1181
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:09,329
And if you interfere again,
I will kill you.

1182
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:13,133
I'm leaving now.

1217
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:00,380
[dramatic music playing]

1218
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:16,564

[panting]

1219
01:13:16,597 --> 01:13:17,999
[man]
Hard to believe, ain't it?

1220
01:13:18,032 --> 01:13:18,933
[Delaine] Surely is.

1221
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:20,902
Sheriff filed a murder

1222
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:23,170
and another body
dragged from the reservoir.

1223
01:13:23,204 --> 01:13:25,206
Sure is some meanness
in this world.

1224
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:26,707
Amen to that.

1225
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,016
Tillman, what'll you have?

1226
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,617
You got a minute?

1227
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:37,818
Just about.

1228
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,489
That is one heck of a shiner
you got on your head.

1229
01:13:44,725 --> 01:13:46,994
You know the last time there was
a murder in this county?

1230
01:13:48,896 --> 01:13:52,099
- Nearly 30 years ago.
- Okay.

1231
01:13:52,133 --> 01:13:56,537
Okay, so now there's been
three murders in just a few
days.

1232
01:13:57,271 --> 01:13:58,739
[phone ringing]

1233
01:14:00,675 --> 01:14:02,510
Hold on. Gotta take this.

1234
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:05,146
Yeah?

1235
01:14:08,249 --> 01:14:09,617
Is that right?

1236
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:12,720
When was this?

1237
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:14,487
I'll be there directly.

1238
01:14:17,658 --> 01:14:20,528
Make that four murders.

1239
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:23,097
Russ Potter's body
was just found in the reservoir.

1240
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,465
Not far from Lucius McFalls.

1241
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,902
No, that's not--

1242
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:28,903
That's not possible.

1243
01:14:28,936 --> 01:14:30,638
I just saw him the other night.

1244
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:32,740
You know what all four
have in common?

1245
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:35,076
You.

1246
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,611
What are you saying?

1247
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:39,947
Oh, see, there's your daddy.

1248
01:14:39,981 --> 01:14:42,016
Russ Potter
was-was your neighbor.

1249
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:44,018
You worked with Lucius McFalls.

1250
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,654
And Sheriff Fowler,

1251
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,056
he was investigating
your daddy's killing

1252
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:52,626
at the same time
as his murder.

1253
01:14:53,627 --> 01:14:55,262
Don't that strike you odd?

1254
01:14:56,831 --> 01:14:59,233
Kane, your mind is perverted.

1255
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:04,271
I'm not gonna sit here
and take the slanderous attacks
on my character.

1256
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:06,107
If you'll excuse me,

1257
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,643
Miss Betty over at table seven
needs her check.

1258
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:11,278
Hey, hey, just one more thing.

1259
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:15,750
Now, how come you drove
Russ Potter's car

1260
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:16,951
to work this morning?

1261
01:15:16,984 --> 01:15:18,753
He let me borrow it.

1262
01:15:18,786 --> 01:15:19,887
And where's your car?

1263
01:15:21,789 --> 01:15:22,990
It got stolen.

1264
01:15:23,024 --> 01:15:24,625
Did you report it missing?

1265
01:15:24,658 --> 01:15:26,260
I'm reporting it now.

1266
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:28,929
Excuse me.

1267
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:32,633
[phone ringing]

1268
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:35,603
Miss Betty.
Here you go.

1269
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:37,271
- [Dewey] Delaine!
- Comin'.

1270
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:38,873
[Dewey] It's for you.

1271
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:40,708
Now, you know I don't
like personal calls.

1272
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:42,777
Make it quick, please.

1273
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:43,778
[clears throat]

1274
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:45,913
Hello?

01:15:45,946 --> 01:15:47,181
[Pernie] <i>Where will you be</i>

- Who is this?
<i>- Oh, who do you think?</i>

1278
01:15:52,953 --> 01:15:57,058
- What do you want?
- You're a bright girl,
figure it out.

1279
01:15:57,091 --> 01:16:01,095
<i>-</i> How much?
<i>- Well, half sounds good.</i>

1280
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:03,030
I wasn't gonna be so greedy,

1281
01:16:03,064 --> 01:16:04,932
<i>but since you put me</i>
<i>out of work</i>

1282
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:08,669
<i>and jobs for women my age</i>
<i>aren't all that plentiful,</i>

1283
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:11,038
<i>I think I deserve to be greedy.</i>

1284
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:12,640
Yeah, well,
I ain't got the money yet.

1285
01:16:12,673 --> 01:16:14,842
Oh, I know that.

1286
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:18,012
But when you do,
don't forget about old Pernie.

1287
01:16:18,045 --> 01:16:20,881
Old Pernie knows everything.

1288
01:16:20,915 --> 01:16:23,918
<i>And don't think you</i>
<i>can get rid of me</i>
<i>like you did the others.</i>

1289
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:27,088
The minute you
step foot on my property,

1290
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:30,191
you'll be dead before
the other foot hits the ground.

1291
01:16:30,224 --> 01:16:32,760
And turn your cell phone on.

1292
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:35,162
Pernie don't like being ignored.

1293

[clears throat]

1295
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:51,178
You sure work a lot.

1296
01:16:51,212 --> 01:16:53,280
Yeah, well,
I got bills to pay.

1297
01:16:53,314 --> 01:16:56,250
Well, I would pray that
I'm on the top of that list,

1298
01:16:57,151 --> 01:16:58,652
We got a problem.

1299
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:02,756
We got a problem, huh?
What is our problem?

1300
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:03,757
Pernie.

1301
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,693
What's a Pernie?

1302
01:17:05,726 --> 01:17:07,962
Oh, Pernie's not a what,
she's a who.

1303
01:17:07,995 --> 01:17:09,964
And so why is she our problem?

1304
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:14,068
Because she knows everything.
And she wants a big cut,

1305
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:16,237
and if she don't get it,
she's gonna go to the police.

1306
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:21,909
And if she does, I go to jail,
which means no insurance money.

1307
01:17:21,942 --> 01:17:23,911
Well, I still don't see
how she's our problem.

1308
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:24,845
She's your problem.

1309
01:17:24,879 --> 01:17:26,881
She wants a cut,
give her a cut of your cut.

1310
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:28,816
Nice upgrade, by the way.

1311
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:32,453
When I say she wants a cut,
she wants all of it.

1312
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,988
She's blackmailing me.

1313
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:39,059

Ain't nobody here.

1317
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,378
Maybe we got the wrong house.

1318
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,981
No, we got the right house.

1319
01:19:07,014 --> 01:19:09,083
This is the address
Delaine gave me.

1320
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:11,919
Maybe they're out for supper.

1321
01:19:11,952 --> 01:19:13,187
At midnight?

1322
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,089

- Well, yeah.
- Well, then why
ain't she starting?

Uh, I don't know.

01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:29,704
[chuckles] Arrest?
What charge?

1389
01:24:29,737 --> 01:24:31,806
You're under arrest for
the murders of Carl Moore,

1390
01:24:31,839 --> 01:24:35,142
Russ Potter, Lucius McFalls,
and Pernie Cannon.

1391
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:37,277
Now, you have the right
to remain silent.

1392
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:41,415
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in the court of law.

1393
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:42,750
You have the right to attorney.

1394
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:44,151
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

1395
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:46,654
one will be appointed to you.

1396
01:24:46,688 --> 01:24:48,756
Do you understand
these rights I've said to you?

1397
01:24:49,657 --> 01:24:50,825
Sure.

1398
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:54,328
[chuckles]

1399
01:24:55,329 --> 01:24:56,631
[sighs]

1400
01:24:57,832 --> 01:24:59,132
Thank you.

1401
01:25:04,806 --> 01:25:06,139
Mm.

1402
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,209
Y'all don't understand.

1403
01:25:09,242 --> 01:25:11,378
Understand what?

1404
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:13,681
Well, I was only doing
what come natural.

1405
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:16,684
Ain't greed natural?

1406
01:25:17,785 --> 01:25:20,855
How can you or God blame me?

1407
01:25:20,888 --> 01:25:22,590
You broke the law.

1408
01:25:22,624 --> 01:25:24,626
The law.

1409
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:28,796
Oh, okay. So I'm a sinner
because I broke the law?

1410
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:33,668
Mm. Or did I break the law

1411
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:36,169
because I'm a sinner?

1412
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:37,672
[Tillman]
What does it matter?

1413
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:43,911
Well, it matters
'cause if I knew the answer,

1414
01:25:43,945 --> 01:25:46,614
I'd be free.

1415
01:25:46,648 --> 01:25:49,416
Yeah, I don't... I don't know
about any of that, but...

1416
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:52,854
I suggest you stop talking.

1417
01:25:58,559 --> 01:26:00,528
All right. Let's go.

1418
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:05,767
[dramatic music playing]

1419
01:26:12,674 --> 01:26:15,342
[Thurmond]
<i>It's a funny question to ask.</i>

1420
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,477
<i>"Where are you after you die?"</i>

1421
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,449
<i>For me, it's not</i>
<i>an altogether unpleasant place,</i>

1422
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:24,819
<i>but I can't speak for</i>
<i>other souls.</i>

1423
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:28,990
<i>And I do sense that if</i>
<i>the totality of your actions</i>

1424
01:26:29,023 --> 01:26:30,992
<i>are more good than bad,</i>

1425
01:26:31,025 --> 01:26:34,729
<i>you end up on the right side</i>
<i>of your maker.</i>

1426
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:38,633
<i>For those who tip the scales</i>
<i>the other way,</i>

1427
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:43,004
<i>well,</i>
<i>as the radio preacher says,</i>

1428
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:45,807
<i>"Hell is hell."</i>

1429

1
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:37,331
Hey, hey, it's okay.

2
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:41,134
Shh... Listen, everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

3
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:53,146
<i>Some folks say,</i>
<i>life is an open book.</i>

4
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,284
<i>You're born, you live, you die,</i>

5
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,855
<i>and not much changes</i>
<i>in between.</i>

6
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,257
<i>Me, I've had a front row seat</i>
<i>of human nature</i>

7
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,529
<i>long enough to know</i>
<i>that sin corrupts.</i>

8
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:12,567
<i>And that species of sin</i>
<i>known as greed</i>
<i>corrupts absolutely.</i>

9
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,804
<i>Some people</i>
<i>just like rolling the dice.</i>

10
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:20,508
<i>And if you get snake eyes,</i>
<i>well, you just deal with it.</i>

11
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,176
<i>That's life in Mississippi</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

12
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,880
<i>Even the Magnolia State.</i>

13
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,616
<i>What goes down</i>
<i>in the heat of passion,</i>

14
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,284
<i>or just plain stupidity,</i>

15
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,554
<i>can haunt a body forever.</i>

16
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,457
<i>No matter where you go.</i>

17
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:41,629
<i>Some things just have a way</i>
<i>of sticking to your soul...</i>

18
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:45,198
<i>and staining it for eternity.</i>

19
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,707
<i>Hell is real, my friends.</i>

20
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,375
<i>It was prepared</i>
<i>for the devil and his angels,</i>

21
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,746
<i>but sinners who follow after</i>
<i>the devil's wicked ways</i>

22
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,683
<i>will be thrown into</i>
<i>the unquenchable lake of fire.</i>

23
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,986
<i>For sinners, they're not</i>
<i>covered in the blood of Jesus.</i>

24
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,388
<i>Be aware, God is not...</i>

25
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,859
<i>You can't go around drinkin',</i>
<i>gamblin', stealin'</i>

26
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:16,731
<i>killin', whorin' around</i>
<i>and think God'll just</i>
<i>turn a blind eye to it all.</i>

27
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,533
<i>Friend, you need to repent.</i>

28
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,601
<i>You need to accept Jesus</i>

29
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,937
<i>and let him pay the price</i>
<i>for your sins.</i>

30
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:28,843
<i>What will you choose:</i>
<i>heaven or hell?</i>

31
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,547
<i>Don't be fooled,</i>
<i>God is comin', death is comin'.</i>

32
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,314
<i>It's coming for us all.</i>

33
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,450
<i>It's right around the corner</i>
<i>for some of you.</i>

34
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,920
<i>And where will you be</i>
<i>when it finds you?</i>

35
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:42,355
<i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

36
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,798
Thank you.

37
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,831
- I ordered you pancakes.
- To go I hope.

38
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:02,804
Oh...

39
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,874
Is this true?

40
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:08,676
You know, you need to
take it easy, Cecil.

41
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,611
Tell me the paper got it wrong.

42
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,880
Generally,
the <i>Gazette</i> is right.

43
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:17,084
Well, I see that you gentlemen
have lots to talk about.

44
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:19,020
I'll see you at the office.

45
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,822
Excuse me.

46
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,023
How?

47
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,424
You said it was a done deal.
A sure thing.

48
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,061
Okay, Cecil, sometimes
it doesn't go as planned,
all right.

49
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:30,097
- I want my money back.
- Cecil, that's not possible.

50
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,632
- Okay?
- I want it back!

51
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,105
You know,
I didn't hear you complaining

52
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,607
when I made you
a bundle of cash

53
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,442
on that tech stock
a few months ago.

54
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,946
No, but then you made
Roland sound so good,

55
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,447
I put in all I had to buy it.

56
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,550
That's your decision,
Cecil, not mine.

57
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,586
So, that's it?

58
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,420
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

59
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,156
Oh, there's nothing you can do?

60
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,525
But there's something I can do.

61
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,660
You just wait.

62
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,996
What's deserving's
coming for you.

63
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,131
- Coffee, Russ?
- Yes, please.

64
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,534
- Mm.
- This ain't over.

65
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,935
Not even close.

66
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,004
Ma'am.

67
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,743
- Thanks for saving me.
- Huh. Yeah.

68
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,981
What's got his dander up?

69
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,550
There were
a couple of companies
that were supposed to merge,

70
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,086
and if they did the stock
would've skyrocketed and...

71
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,655
- And they didn't?
- No, ma'am, they didn't.

72
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,658
Hm. And you persuaded him
to buy some

73
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,426
Unfortunately,
a lot of people, yeah.

74
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,965
I wouldn't want to be you today.

75
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,433
Well, why don't you
come over for supper tonight?

76
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,003
I'm making beef stew
for me and Daddy,

77
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:45,172
and I expect you
might want a little company.

78
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,009
You would expect to be right.

79
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,453
You know, I won't forget,
I never forget.

80
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,189
And he will call you back.

81
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,225
We both know you, it's fine.

82
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,961
Yes. You can--
Oh, hold on.

83
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,963
Phone won't stop ringing.

84
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,732
Got more than a dozen
messages here so far.

85
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,201
Well, I guess
I'm the town pariah, Pernie.

86
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,037
Seems so.

87
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,140
- You got a visitor.
- Hm?

88
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,473
The sheriff.

89
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,977
Oh, shit.

90
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,918
What do I owe the pleasure?

91
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,058
I told my brother to be
careful about investing.

92
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,995
He wanted to build himself
a nest egg.

93
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:44,865
Retire. He trusted you.

94
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:50,171
Little Russ Potter.

95
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,040
Gone off to the big city
and made some money.

96
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,677
Or so they say.

97
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:59,647
Now he's coming back
to share his Midas touch.

98
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,051
My brother taught you
in eighth grade, I believe.

99
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,786
Yep. He was a good man.

100
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,522
He is a good man.

101
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:11,158
But he's a lot poorer today
than he was yesterday.

102
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,597
Now I'm not blaming you
for all of it.

103
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,666
He chose to roll the dice,

104
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,568
nobody made him do it.

105
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,104
But he was led to believe

106
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,873
that the odds were more
in his favor than they were.

107
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,775
- I gave your brother...
- Really?

108
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,610
...and all the investors,

109
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,946
the most up to date information
that's available to me.

110
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,014
You understand that?

111
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,583
So much for the Midas touch.

112
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,852
All right,
what are you accusing me of?

113
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,687
If I'm not accusing you
of anything.

114
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,022
Yeah, well, shit,
you could fooled me.

115
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,790
- Fooling?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,926
Now, there's a word I bet
you know a thing or two about.

117
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,169
You might want to get that.

118
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,306
I imagine there are
a lot of people around town

119
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,641
that want to talk to you.

120
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:06,814
And, Russ, I wouldn't
go jaywalking,

121
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:12,787
or speeding at 26 or 27
miles an hour through a 25 zone.

122
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,823
There's been a little
uptick in crime.

123
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,291
We're trying to control it.

124
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,859
You understand?

125
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,304
This is Russ Potter.

126
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,672
<i>Where will you be</i>

127
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,307
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

128
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,809
Excuse me?

129
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:38,879
What the hell?

130
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:59,300
Hello?

131
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,236
<i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

132
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,238
Who is this,
and how'd you get my number?

133
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,240
<i>That ain't an answer.</i>

134
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,908
Who the hell is this?

135
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,777
<i>You'll soon find out.</i>

136
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,760
- You okay?
- Yes, I, just zoned out
for a second.

137
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,196
Yeah. Happens to me
all the time.

138
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,365
Hey, Delaine said you're
coming up for supper tonight?

139
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,033
Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir.

140
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,201
See you at 6:30.

141
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,442
That is delicious beef stew.

142
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,977
Compliments to the chef.

143
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,812
Nobody makes it like Delaine.

144
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,947
Well, I can't take the credit.

145
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,883
I did get the recipe
from the diner.

146
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,317
You did the cooking though.

147
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,420
Well, I appreciate
you all having me.

148
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:56,857
Uh, Delaine tells me
you had a rough day today.

149
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,393
Yeah, you could say that.

150
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,795
Oh, yeah.
Cecil Hammett threatened him.

151
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,231
Cecil's an idiot.

152
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,133
- Well--
- But he gets it natural.

153
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,703
His old man was probably
the dumbest person I ever met.

154
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,006
It's a wonder Cecil's
as bright as he is.

155
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,074
- It was still scary.
- Mm.

156
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,911
I hope other folks
took the news better.

157
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,279
You know, a lot of people
don't know this,

158
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,347
but, you know,
I lost a lot of money, as well.

159
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,484
You know,
I'm hurtin' just like, uh,

160
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,419
you know, everybody.
Maybe even more.

161
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,356
And you're sure
Cecil's not a threat?

162
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,793
No way. No.

163
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,228
But, I mean...

164
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,396
But?

165
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:43,337
So, I got a, uh, call today,
sort of threatening.

166
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,206
- I guess.
- Sort of?

167
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:48,742
Hm. I got a call from a fellow
and he asked me,

168
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,079
"Where will you be
the minute you wake up dead?"

169
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,151
- That's eerie.
- Mm.

170
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,520
You call the law?

171
00:11:58,553 --> 00:11:59,887
No.

172
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,157
Well, why not?

173
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,426
Well, I just felt like
he's trying to rattle me.

174
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,794
You know?

175
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,230
Russ...

176
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:10,998
Don't mess around with this.

177
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,166
You should call them.

178
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,000
Delaine's right.

179
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,902
You can't be
too careful nowadays,

180
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,538
people are crazy.

181
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,239
Maybe the police
can trace the call.

182
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:21,275
No, I don't think so,
I mean, it came up
as an unknown caller.

183
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,245
You gotta call the sheriff.

184
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:27,881
Anyways, I don't wanna take up
any more your time.

185
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,917
I appreciate the dinner.
Thanks again.

186
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,485
Uh, hey,
let me walk you home.

187
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,053
- Oh, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,396
I-I thought I'd be
just honest with you--

189
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,400
the stew had just a little
too much salt in it for me.

190
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,104
Nice.

191
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,006
Listen, I wanna
thank you for supper.

192
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,307
- Oh.
- It was delicious.

193
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,509
Any time.

194
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,812
You feel like, uh, coming in?

195
00:12:58,846 --> 00:12:59,913
I'd love to.

196
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:03,384
Come on in.

197
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,286
Thank you.

198
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:09,056
- Can I interest you in beer?
- Yeah, sure.

199
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,491
- I could go for one.
- Nice.

200
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,060
Yeah, I got them
in the garage.

201
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,028
Let me go grab 'em.

202
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,032
Oh, it's just Pernie.

203
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,334
Hey, Pernie, what's up?

204
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,168
<i>Sorry to bother, Russ,</i>

205
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,538
<i>Horace's medical report</i>
<i>came back.</i>

206
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:26,373
- Yeah?
<i>- Not looking good</i>
<i>for the poor fella.</i>

207
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,076
- Okay.
<i>- Is it okay if I stay</i> <i>with Horace for a bit?</i>

208
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,446
Pernie, listen, just take
as much time as you want.

209
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,148
- All right?
<i>- Sure.</i>

210
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,550
If you want to take
two, three days off,

211
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,217
that's totally fine. Okay?

212
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,186
<i>I just hate to</i>
<i>leave you right now.</i>

213
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,088
No, I want you just to relax.

214
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,290
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Yep.

215
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:47,494
Pernie, just take care
of Horace. All right?

216
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,196
<i>Thank you, Russ.</i>

217
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,998
- Okay.
<i>- Thank you, thank you.</i>

218
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm sorry, honey.
Good night.

219
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:54,301
<i>I so appreciate it. Bye.</i>

220
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,106
Everything all right?

221
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,876
Pernie's, uh, afraid her
husband's cancer came back.

222
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,844
Oh.

223
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,882
Well, speaking of which,

224
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,185
how's your dad doing?

225
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,420
Mm. He's fine.

226
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:14,656
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,423
Been cancer free
for about a year now.

228
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,425
You know,
I-I wanted to ask him,

229
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,327
but I just kind of
felt odd about it.

230
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,530
You can ask him, he don't mind.

231
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:25,032
There's something
that I'm curious about.

232
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,434
What's that?

233
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:29,870
Why haven't you been married?

234
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,377
So you feel odd
asking about my daddy's health,

235
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,113
but you're just fine
asking my love life?

236
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,317
Uh, well, uh, hm...

237
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,054
Let's just say the pickens
in Bare Hollow are kinda slim,

238
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,590
if you hadn't noticed.

239
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,992
So why have you stayed?

240
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:55,329
Daddy, mostly.

241
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,198
Besides, I've been here
my whole life.

242
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,935
I don't know where I'm go
or what I'd do when I got there.

243
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,203
Hm.

244
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,309
You know,
I'm gonna tell you something...

245
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,616
I've had a crush on you
since high school.

246
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,318
- You never let on.
- Mm-mm.

247
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,320
How come?

248
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,222
Well, I mean, you know,

249
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,659
you were kinda part of
the popular crew

250
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,529
and I just-- shit,
I didn't think you were
that interested in me.

251
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:34,401
So... would that be
the reason that you
rented this house?

252
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:36,470
No, no, no, no, no.

253
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,405
So-so the price was right,
obviously.

254
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,007
- Mm-hm.
- As you know,
and then, you know,

255
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,610
I thought, well, you know...

256
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:45,412
It ain't so bad to be next to
the prettiest girl in town.

257
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,384
Hm.

258
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,313
- All right.
- You don't--

259
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:35,262
- Yeah?
-  - <i>Where will you</i> <i>be the minute you wake up dead?</i>

260
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,364
Hey, I want you
to listen to me.

261
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,366
Fuck you.

262
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,467
You hear me?

263
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:42,504
<i>You'll find out.</i>

264
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:43,705
Son of a bitch.

265
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,708
Wait...

266
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:50,277
- Wait, was that the caller?
- Yeah.

267
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,514
Okay, Russ,
you gotta promise me

268
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:55,249
that you'll see Sheriff Fowler
in the morning.

269
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,483
I promise.

270
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,318
- Okay.
- Yeah.

271
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,751
You got any plans
this weekend?

272
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:30,450
I might.

273
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,755
What's going on Tillman?

274
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:35,489
Hey, good morning, Russ.

275
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,257
- Thurmond in?
- Yep.

276
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,425
Thank you.

277
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,065
Yeah.

278
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,270
May I?

279
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:51,204
Yeah.

280
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:55,810
Well, I've been getting
some threatening phone calls

281
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,144
I wanted to talk to you about.

282
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,147
Threatening phone calls.

283
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,115
Shocking.

284
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:04,184
From?

285
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,452
Well, I don't know.

286
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:09,591
From more than one person?

287
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:12,426
I mean, it seems like
the same person

288
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,696
How old?

289
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:18,165
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd probably say
he's younger than older.

290
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,634
How many calls?

291
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:21,736
Three so far.

292
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,574
So, what exactly
did he say to you?

293
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,744
Where will you be
the minute you wake up dead?

294
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,278
That's it?

295
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,549
What do you mean, that's it?
Yeah, that's it.

296
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:38,418
- You get a number?
- No, it's coming from
an unknown number.

297
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:43,524
Eh, it's likely somebody
upset with you over the merger.

298
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:46,861
Or the, uh... non-merger.

299
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,599
I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

300
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,235
- Hm.
- I mean, if he wanted to
kill you, you'd be dead by now.

301
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:58,271
You know what, Sheriff,
that's-that's really
comforting.

302
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,743
But what happens
if the calls continue?

303
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,778
- What do you do?
- Ah.

304
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:06,279
They'll probably get tired of it
when they find out

305
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,750
that they can't
get you flustered.

306
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:09,651
So that's it?

307
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:11,184
All I can do.

308
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:11,886
- Yeah.
- For now.

309
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,286
You're right.

310
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,667
- Mm.
- There you go.

311
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,701
Thank you.

312
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,268
So, did you go?

313
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,538
To the sheriff?
Yeah, I went.

314
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,339
And?

315
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,510
Delaine, he don't give a shit.
Come on, now.

316
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,645
Well, that's the last time
I'm gonna vote for him.

317
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:39,647
Well,
what are you gonna do?

318
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,481
I don't know, I mean,
I'll probably just

319
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,583
ignore the calls.

320
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:50,190
- Hm.
- More importantly though,
last night was perfect.

321
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,360
I know.

322
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,930
I would love to
hit the rewind switch,
if you know what I mean.

323
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,231
Mm-hm.

324
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,901
Well, I'm working
the supper shift tonight,

325
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,469
but, uh, tomorrow night?

326
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,772
Nah, I can't do it tomorrow,
I'm busy.

327
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:07,642
You ain't got no plans,
nobody likes you right now.

328
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:09,944
All right, I'll be there.

329
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,913
- All right, then.
- Mm-hm.

330
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:30,464
This is Russ Potter here.

331
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:33,935
<i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

332
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:37,471
Listen to me,
if you're trying to scare me,
it's not working.

333
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,473
You hear me? It's not working.

334
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,482
<i>Go!</i>

335
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,044
Delaine, honey.

336
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:59,914
I'm sorry.
I just heard, I'm sorry.

337
00:22:59,947 --> 00:23:03,584
I don't understand it.
Who'd wanna kill Daddy?

338
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,620
Okay, let's go inside.
Come on.

339
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:19,600
I know this is difficult,
but I have to ask
some questions.

340
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,169
When did you find your daddy?

341
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:26,874
Uh, after I come home

342
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,543
from the breakfast shift
at the diner.

343
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:30,878
What time was that?

344
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,715
Around ten o'clock.

345
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:36,150
Thurmond, can't this wait?

346
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,819
No. No, it cannot.

347
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,191
According to the coroner,

348
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,994
Carl was killed
sometime before midnight.

349
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:51,565
When did you last see him?

350
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,135
Uh, just before I left
for the supper shift.

351
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,671
Did your daddy have any enemies?

352
00:23:56,704 --> 00:24:01,742
Anybody he had recently
had a quarrel or...
a disagreement with?

353
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:05,046
- No.
- Did he owe money to anybody?

354
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,948
No.

355
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,516
Anything missing?

356
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,085
Not that I know of.

357
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:16,691
Don't understand.
Somebody wanted
your father dead.

358
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:19,860
- Thurmond.
- What?

359
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,896
What if Carl wasn't the target?

360
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,496
What do you mean?

361
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:26,534
Well, I've been telling you
that I've been getting
threatening phone calls, right?

362
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:27,668
So?

363
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:29,870
Well, maybe I was the target.

364
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:32,506
- You? How?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,875
I mean, it could've been wrong.
Shit, I live right next door.

366
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,978
- Wrong house?
- Mm-hm.

367
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,014
Well, I suppose it's possible,

368
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:43,884
but I would think
that anybody who
wanted to kill you

369
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:44,919
would know where you live.

370
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:47,755
It's a small town.

371
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,792
Who lost the most?

372
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:53,561
I mean,
I don't know that off hand,

373
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:57,631
I would have to check but...
I mean, people lost...

374
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:59,700
thousands and thousands
of dollars.

375
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:03,637
Might be.

376
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:08,776
I heard of it happening
a few years back
down in Jones County.

377
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:14,015
A man hired a hit man
to kill his wife's lover,
but gave him the wrong address.

378
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:16,784
Wound up splitting the throat
of a local preacher.

379
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:20,654
- It's all your fault, Thurmond.
- Hm?

380
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:24,191
If you had just listened to Russ
when he come you,

381
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,027
my daddy might not be dead.

382
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,662
Come on, now.
We don't know what happened.

383
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,765
Let's not go pointing fingers
just yet.

384
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:36,670
Russ, I'm gonna need the names,
phone numbers and addresses

385
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:39,607
of all the people
who lost money.

386
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,776
I'll get it to you
tomorrow morning.

387
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,811
Ah, it's gonna take some time.

388
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:49,984
Ah, again,
I'm-I'm sorry for your loss.

389
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,886
But we'll find out
who did this.

390
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,220
I promise you.

391
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:54,889
Yeah, well, I hold you to that.

392
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:55,990
Please do.

393
00:25:57,358 --> 00:25:59,560
I'll get back to you
when I know more.

394
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:05,900
Delaine.

395
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,269
Mm.

396
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,173
Hey, what can I do for you?

397
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:13,974
Can I just
stay with you for a while?

398
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:16,010
Of course.

399
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:19,747
'Cause I can't stand
the thought of being here
with Dad gone.

400
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,016
Of course.
Stay as long as you want.

401
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,250
Hey, come here.

402
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:30,057
Can't believe
somebody's so mad at you,
they'd want to kill you.

403
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,659
Mm-hm.

404
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:33,828
Well, it can be
a wicked world, can't it?

405
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:34,862
Hm.

406
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,364
Are you still religious?

407
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,701
No.

408
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:43,070
Why not?

409
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:46,407
I've rode the-the devil's back
way too many times.

410
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,144
I might burn up if I walk into
a church at this point.

411
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:52,313
Is that why you come home?

412
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,914
Yeah. I mean,
I needed to plug in.

413
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,149
I mean, why not here at home?

414
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,183
Hm.

415
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,925
You're still going to church.

416
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:08,262
My mama was strict about it,
but...

417
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:13,400
after she died
from taking ammonia
we never went back.

418
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:16,137
- Hm.
- Daddy blamed God
for taking her from him.

419
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,639
Just... couldn't forgive Him.

420
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:26,080
You know what I've never
understood about religion?

421
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:27,848
What?

422
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,884
Well, are we sinners
because we sin,

423
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:33,821
or do we sin
because we're born sinners?

424
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:39,960
And if it's the latter,
then what right
does God have to judge us?

425
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:41,028
Hm?

426
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:45,466
If you ever figure it out,
let me know.

427
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:03,117
I got all the information
that you asked for:

428
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,120
names, addresses,
phone numbers,

429
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:07,821
and exactly
what they invested.

430
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,390
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

431
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,367
I'm sorry for not taking you
more seriously about
these phone calls.

432
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:22,069
Mm.

433
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,204
You got anymore?

434
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,906
No, no,
not since Carl was killed.

435
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:30,512
You really think
it's the wrong house?

436
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:32,846
And you knew Carl pretty well,
didn't you?

437
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,050
No, I mean, I moved in
two months ago
and met him there.

438
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:39,053
Ever see any
suspicious people over?

439
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,956
No. I mean, he didn't seem like
the kinda person
that got in trouble.

440
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:44,258
I mean, if you ask me,
he was a gentle soul.

441
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,361
So, wrong house is still
the best theory then.

442
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:49,797
Yeah.

443
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,465
Let me know if you
need anything else.

444
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,300
Uh, Russ.

445
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,135
Be careful.

446
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:57,771
Any of this theory is correct,

447
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:59,406
this guy may not be done.

448
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:30,204
- Hey.
- Hey.

449
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:31,805
What are you doing?

450
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,810
I'm, uh, getting rid of
some of Daddy's things.

451
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,413
I thought you weren't ready
to go back in the house yet.

452
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:42,483
I'm not, really.

453
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:46,186
Just didn't want to
put it off for too long.

454
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,524
What about these?
Where do you want 'em?

455
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:51,859
You can set him right there.
I'll get him in a sec.

456
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,227
Thanks.

457
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,899
- Who's that Delaine?
- That's Lucius.

458
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:01,468
You might have seen him work in
the kitchen at the diner.

459
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:03,003
No, no.

460
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:05,339
Well, I thought he could use
a little extra money,

461
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:07,509
so I asked him to help me
pack up the house.

462
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,844
So you're moving, huh?
That's it.

463
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,380
Yeah.

464
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:16,050
Yeah, I'm gonna sell it.

465
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,219
I can't live here no more
after what happened.

466
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:21,589
- You understand.
- Of course, yeah.

467
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:24,992
Just, uh...
seems a bit sudden is all.

468
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:27,294
I know.

469
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,197
It's not like I'm-I'm moving
today or tomorrow.

470
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,300
Right.
Yeah, all right.

471
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:36,103
Well, shit, let me know
if you need anything.

472
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:39,574
- Ru-- Hey, Russ.
- I think I may have lost
one of my gold hoop earrings

473
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,942
at your house,
so if you come across it,
let me know.

474
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:45,979
Daddy gave them to me, so...

475
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,247
All right, will do.

476
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,327
Hey.

477
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,995
You shouldn't have come out
when he was there,

478
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,897
he might have
recognized your voice.

479
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,933
I didn't know he was there
until I stepped out.

480
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,435
Hey, you said
he wouldn't be home.

481
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:10,070
He wasn't supposed to be.

482
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:12,339
Well, now my fault then.

483
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:14,942
- When do I get my money?
- Soon enough.

484
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:17,111
- Well, when?
- When the check comes in.

485
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,581
We have been through this.
Relax.

486
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,215
Yeah, easy for you to say.

487
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:23,150
I owe people money.
I told you that.

488
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:25,587
And they won't wait,
so I can't wait.

489
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,555
It's just a few more days.

490
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:28,590
Hey.

491
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:34,662
Hm.

492
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:36,631
Money will be here any day now.

493
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:39,099
You'll see.

494
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,702
- Well, it better be.
- Mm-hm.

495
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:44,706
Shit!

496
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:47,374
I found your earring.

497
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,110
Where on Earth did you find it?

498
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:52,045
Under the couch.
Soon as you walk in.

499
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,016
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

500
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,552
I gotta get back to the office.

501
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:58,986
I'll see you soon.

502
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,220
Okay. Bye.

503
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,491
Did you threaten Russ Potter?

504
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:07,961
Well...

505
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:09,196
Well, what?

506
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,299
Sorta, yeah.

507
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,968
But not really.

508
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:18,005
Well, which is it?
You did, or you didn't?

509
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,274
Well, I did.

510
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:22,209
But-but I didn't mean it.

511
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,646
I mean, I-I meant it at the time
but-but not now.

512
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,013
I wouldn't hurt nobody.

513
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:27,582
How much did you invest?

514
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,452
Oh, well, I--
I'd rather not say.

515
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,320
Ten-thousand
sound about right?

516
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,290
Oh, gosh all mighty, darn.

517
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,192
If you knew then why'd you ask?

518
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:41,061
Awful lot of money to lose.

519
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:42,630
You sure you didn't mean it?

520
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:45,265
No. Oh, no.

521
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,367
Like I said,
I meant it at the time.

522
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,671
I was mad.
Hell, I was more than mad.

523
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:50,605
I wanted to hurt him.

524
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,609
- But now...
- Now what?

525
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:58,546
I decided to forgive Russ.

526
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,314
It's the Christian thing to do.

527
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:03,651
- Let me ask you a question.
- Shoot.

528
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:06,253
Where will you be
the minute to wake up dead?

529
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,323
Pardon?

530
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:13,227
Where will you be,
the minute you wake up dead?

531
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,063
I don't understand.

532
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:21,468
No, I don't think you do, Cecil.

533
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,538
All right. You can go.

534
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:26,508
What kind of question is that?

535
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,476
I said you can go, Cecil.
Bye.

536
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,179
Fine.

537
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:33,447
You ask crazy questions.

538
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,282
I'll just carry my ass
outta here.

539
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,124
And the insurance company
you wanted,

540
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:45,325
it's on line one.

541
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,452
Evening, Lucius.

542
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:16,791
- Look, I know I'm behind.
- Yeah, you're way behind.

543
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:19,794
But I'm about to
come into a lot of money.

544
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:23,230
- You know, I just need--
- I just need you

545
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,532
to give me my money.

546
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,601
Look, and you're gonna get it.

547
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,369
But that's what you
said last week.

548
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:31,405
Oh, but I did a job.

549
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,141
It's gonna pay everything.

550
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:36,476
What kind of job did you do,

551
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:39,514
that's gonna pay you 5k?

552
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:40,748
I killed a man.

553
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,520
- You killed a man?
- Yeah.

554
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:47,622
Who'd you kill, Lucius?

555
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:49,222
Carl Moore.

556
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:52,527
Oh, anyhow.

557
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,397
Yeah, I work with his daughter
Delaine at the diner.

558
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:03,337
And she wanted him killed
to collect a shit load
of insurance money.

559
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,273
- So, I just need--
- I just need!

560
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:08,610
I mean, there you go again
with the I just needs.

561
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:10,377
And so what I need you to know,

562
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,715
is I just need
my motherfucking money.

563
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,449
Just a couple more days.

564
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:16,684
Just a couple more days.

565
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,485
Couple more days!

566
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,623
Just a couple more days!

567
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:23,558
You sound like
a 12-year-old child!

568
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,760
- I swear!
- Oh, you swear, huh?

569
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:28,830
Really shouldn't swear.

570
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:30,497
Says so in the bible.

571
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,900
You know what else
is in the bible?

572
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:36,838
He who beareth false witness,

573
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,906
that man shall perish.

574
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,474
Yeah, faith in youth.

575
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:42,910
Mace.

576
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:47,949
Hey--
Jody!

577
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:50,183
- There's no need!
- Mace!

578
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:51,385
What are you doing?

579
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,921
Man's a fry cook.

580
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:56,824
He needs his hands
to make a living!

581
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:58,358
Use your brain!

582
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:01,261
How's he supposed to pay us,
if he ain't got no hands?

583
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,331
Take off your shoe.

584
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:07,367
Take off your shoe.

585
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:10,605
- Jody, please.
- Take off your shoe
and your goddamn sock.

586
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:12,439
Take off your shoe!

587
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,207
Jody, no, please!

588
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,309
Come on, now!

589
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:18,579
Guys, we're all friends here!

590
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,247
Oh...

591
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:28,255
Stay still.

592
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,294
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
not the pinky toe.

593
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,998
Pink toe's important.

594
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:39,366
Next to the big toe
it's probably
the most important.

595
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,802
You need it for balance.

596
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:43,336
Now that third and fourth toe,

597
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,806
they ain't so important.

598
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,607
Well, which one?

599
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:48,009
Three or four?

600
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:52,513
You know what,
I'm feeling sporting.

601
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:54,414
Why don't you pick, Lucius.

602
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,683
What?

603
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,953
No, no, I can't pick.

604
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,723
Well, you're gonna pick,
or we're gonna take them both.

605
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:04,625
Fourth.

606
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,561
Why'd you pick four?

607
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:07,695
It's smaller.

608
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,297
So it is.

609
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,000
Don't do this.

610
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:28,583
Oh, my toe!

611
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:33,588
Ah, you gonna give me
my money by tomorrow.

612
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:34,856
Or you're gonna have
matching feet.

613
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:46,968
...took my toe!

614
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,077
Look, I ain't foolin'!
I just got my toe cut off!

615
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,446
- What?
- With a bolt cutter!

616
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:02,016
Now give me some damn money!

617
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:06,053
Okay. Okay.
I'll get you some money.

618
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:07,287
Okay?

619
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:13,561
Okay, here, here.

620
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:15,029
Now that's all I got.

621
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:16,496
What is this?

622
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:19,934
One... three...
20... 40...

623
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,602
Sixty-three dollars!

624
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:24,806
I told you,
that's all I got.

625
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,473
Tips were short tonight.

626
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:29,409
Well, then go to an ATM.

627
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:32,680
I don't got
nothing in the bank.

628
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:36,884
Oh, you owe me five grand.

629
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:38,485
And you'll get it.

630
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,622
I'm broke, too. Why do you think
I'm doing all this, huh?

631
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,390
I need the money
just as bad as you do.

632
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:45,392
I doubt that!

633
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,795
You still got all your toes.

634
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:51,398
Now, you need to give me
some serious money or I'll--

635
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,568
Or you'll what? Hm?

636
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:56,469
You're the murderer here.

637
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:59,106
Well, I'll do you
what I did to your daddy.

638
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,042
Oh, are you threatening me?

639
00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:03,978
Now, how would you
get your money then, genius?

640
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:04,879
Soon!

641
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:12,553
<i>What can you tell me</i>
<i>about Lucius McFalls?</i>

642
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:13,521
Your cook.

643
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:18,391
Well, he seems like
a decent enough guy.

644
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:19,627
Good cook.

645
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,097
Well, not great
but good enough.

646
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,733
He gets a little hot-headed
every now and then,

647
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:28,669
but other than that
I got no complaints.

648
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:29,770
Is he in trouble?

649
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:31,438
Not sure yet.

650
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,441
What about Delaine?

651
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:35,810
She cause you any trouble?

652
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:37,979
She is a good waitress.

653
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:40,447
Real personable,
people like her,

654
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,149
especially with men...

655
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:43,751
...she's a little flirty.

656
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:45,786
But she's a hard worker.

657
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,823
She been doing a lot
of extra shifts lately.

658
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:51,125
Why?

659
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:55,096
Because she owes me some money.

660
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:57,798
Why?

661
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:00,167
Oh, come on, Thurmond.

662
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,637
You know, I don't like to
speak ill of the dead,

663
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,674
but her and her old man, they...
they liked to gamble,

664
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:08,843
mostly on the internet,
I think.

665
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,149
She and Lucius friends?

666
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,685
I see 'em talking
from time to time,

667
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:20,187
but she talks to everybody.

668
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:22,089
What's this all about, Thurmond?

669
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:26,560
I wish I knew, Dewey.

670
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:30,965
I wish I knew.

671
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:40,975
Can I have a piece
of cherry pie to go?

672
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:52,179
License and registration,
please.

673
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,049
I wasn't doin' nothing.

674
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:56,917
License and registration.

675
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:03,090
What did I do?

676
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:05,226
You were blocking
two parking spaces.

677
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,227
Huh?

678
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,329
Were straddling the line.

679
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:11,632
There's a town ordinance
against that.

680
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:13,334
There's no one in the lot.

681
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,302
Law's the law, son.

682
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:16,837
It's called a gateway crime.

683
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:19,573
You got to be shittin', me, man.

684
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:21,876
Sorry, sir.

685
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:26,814
You ever get over to
the west part of town?

686
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:29,050
Ah, I haven't been over
that way in a while,

687
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:31,285
You know,
probably a month or longer.

688
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:33,154
A month or longer?

689
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,990
- You're sure about that?
- Mm-hm.

690
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:40,361
Don't go over there
to see Delaine Moore, maybe?

691
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,763
I wouldn't blame you
if you did.

692
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:44,765
Mighty good looking woman?

693
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:48,069
Hell, if I was younger,
I'd try to see her myself.

694
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:51,305
I work with her.
And that's it.

695
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:54,708
Hm. Then you're dumber
than I thought.

696
00:42:57,278 --> 00:42:58,612
Are we done?

697
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:00,815
For now.

698
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,918
Take this is as a warning.

699
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:05,886
Next time I write you a ticket.

700
00:43:57,338 --> 00:43:58,305
Hello?

701
00:43:58,339 --> 00:43:59,373
<i>Where will you be</i>

702
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,809
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

703
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:05,746
Lucius.
Lucius, that ain't funny.

704
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:08,048
<i>You'll soon find out.</i>

705
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,768
Hey, sweetheart.

706
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,270
Hey, Russ.

707
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:30,471
Yeah, what's going on?

708
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,106
Um...

709
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:34,742
Could I maybe
stay at your place tonight,

710
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:37,111
or well, for a couple of nights?

711
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:40,247
Delaine, I've told you before,
you can stay
as long as you want.

712
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:42,049
Thank you.

713
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:44,118
You're good man,
Charlie Brown.

714
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:45,786
I look forward to it.
See you tonight.

715
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:47,254
Okay.

716
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:07,775
You gonna get that, Delaine?

717
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:10,778
Mm. No.

718
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:13,414
It's probably just somebody
trying to sell me something.

719
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,916
Been gettin' a lot
of them calls lately.

720
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,351
Ah, it could be the sheriff.

721
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,820
Might have some news
about the investigation.

722
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:23,257
Fine.

723
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:30,397
Hello.

724
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:31,498
<i>Where will you be</i>

725
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:33,467
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

726
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,969
Sorry, I'm not interested.

727
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:37,805
So, please don't call
this number no more.

728
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:41,342
Mm, that's annoying.

729
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,043
Maybe you ought to
block the caller.

730
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:44,845
Good idea.

731
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:53,787
I got your money.

732
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:56,457
About time.

733
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,459
No, it's too risky
to give it to you here.

734
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,828
Oh, so I'll come
to your place later.

735
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:02,129
No, Russ might see you.

736
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,932
We got to meet somewhere else.

737
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:07,301
How about I come
to your place tonight?

738
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:08,302
Fine with me.

739
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:11,972
I can bring us some wine.
We can celebrate.

740
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:13,274
You got all of it?

741
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,943
Oh, you'll get
everything that's coming to you.

742
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:17,344
I promise.

743
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:18,812
Honest to God.

744
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:06,226
Knock, knock.

745
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,629
Well, hi, over there.

746
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:12,232
I, uh, love what you've, uh,
done with your place.

747
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:19,473
Brought the wine,
as promised.

748
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:21,442
You'd better have
more than wine in there.

749
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:22,910
Oh, I do.

750
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:27,414
I ain't got no wine glasses.

751
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,383
Well, I didn't expect you did,

752
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:32,986
so...voilà.

753
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,155
I told you, I ain't
much of a wine drinker.

754
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,424
Look, I'll just have a beer.

755
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,026
I think you're gonna like this.

756
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,361
It's French.

757
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:44,264
And I've been saving it
for a very special occasion.

758
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:47,167
- Hm.
- Come on, just try it.

759
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,969
Might find yourself surprised.

760
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:56,176
To us, to a perfect plan
and getting rich.

761
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:00,180
Hm.

762
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:01,248
You first.

763
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,017
What, you don't trust me?

764
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,919
Mm-mm.
Why would I?

765
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:11,992
Mmm.

766
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:15,396
Satisfied?

767
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:22,604
Ain't it good?

768
00:48:22,637 --> 00:48:24,672
Eh, it's a little sour.

769
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:27,107
Lucius, you gotta
broaden your horizons.

770
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:29,243
You're about to become
a very rich man.

771
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:32,279
No, not after I pay out
all the money I owe.

772
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:36,383
Well, I think you
should keep some of the money
for yourself and enjoy it.

773
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,185
Treat yourself to some...

774
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:41,488
...imported beer
or some good whiskey or bourbon.

775
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:46,260
Just give me the money.

776
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:48,295
Patience is a virtue, you know.

777
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,532
Mm-hm.

778
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:52,534
Mm.

779
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:57,572
Yeah.

780
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:01,709
It's all gonna be all right.

781
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:07,448
Gonna be over soon.

782
00:49:08,415 --> 00:49:10,250
How?

783
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:14,421
Well, poison was in the glass
before I poured the wine.

784
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:17,224
It's amazing what you can learn
on the internet.

785
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:18,693
Why?

786
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,730
Well, if you
had just been patient,

787
00:49:22,764 --> 00:49:24,599
none of this
would have been necessary.

788
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:27,635
'Cause everything
was going so well.

789
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:32,406
But then you had to go
and make those phone calls
and threaten me.

790
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,509
Calls?

791
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,443
I didn't...

792
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:38,378
I didn't, I swear.

793
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:41,114
Now you only have
yourself to blame, Lucius.

794
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,551
Look at it this way.

795
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:48,723
You're about to uncover
the great enduring mystery.

796
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:53,728
You're gonna find out
where we're all gonna be
when we wake up dead.

797
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:57,097
Well, at least
us sinners anyway.

798
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,069
Mm.

799
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:04,739
It's so good.

800
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:37,170
You seen Lucius?

801
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:38,706
Jada, Lucius?

802
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,140
Anybody seen Lucius?

803
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:42,175
We open in ten minutes.

804
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:45,078
- Hey, you seen Lucius?
- No. He ain't here yet?

805
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:47,247
Well, no he ain't here yet.
And that ain't like him.

806
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:49,483
- All right, well,
you try calling him?
- Yeah, I tried to call him,

807
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:52,452
- but he didn't answer.
- Well, maybe he's
just running late.

808
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:53,621
He'll probably be here soon.

809
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:55,757
Yeah, well, he better.

810
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:07,669
<i>Where will you be</i>
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

811
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:09,069
Lucius?

812
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:14,809
Hey...

813
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:15,877
Let's get a move on.

814
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,110
We gotta open.

815
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:19,146
Uh, Dewey, uh,

816
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:21,481
I'm not feeling so good.
I'm sorry. I gotta go home.

817
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:23,450
Hey, you can't go.

818
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:24,686
I already ain't got no cook!

819
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,353
And Penny called,
said she's gonna be late.

820
00:51:26,386 --> 00:51:29,122
I'm sorry, I have to go.

821
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:30,424
Delaine--

822
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:32,760
You better be back
for the lunch shift.

823
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,638
Lucius...

824
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,295
Answer.

825
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,632
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Russ.

826
00:52:10,665 --> 00:52:13,200
- <i>Hey there.</i>
- Hey, uh, hey, listen,

827
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,669
I'm just-- I'm just calling
to let you know

828
00:52:14,702 --> 00:52:15,937
I'm going to stay at your house
again tonight,

829
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,171
- if that's all right.
- <i>You know it is.</i>

830
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,775
- <i>You okay?</i>
- No.

831
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:21,943
<i>What's wrong?</i>

832
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:23,544
I'll tell you

833
00:52:23,578 --> 00:52:26,781
when I get home from my shift,
okay, just please be there.

834
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:27,915
<i>No problem.</i>

835
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:29,784
Bye.

836
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:49,637
Get out of my car.

837
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:51,639
Who are you?

838
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:53,775
Easy now, wildcat.

839
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:56,276
We're friends of Lucius.

840
00:52:57,512 --> 00:52:59,580
Or rather we was.

841
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:00,782
What do you mean?

842
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:03,851
Seems our friend Lucius is dead,

843
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:05,285
which is a shame.

844
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:07,622
'Cause he owed me
a shit load of money.

845
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,224
But silver lining,

846
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:13,895
you just came into a shit load.

847
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:17,632
So seeing as Lucius is dead
and you're the one
who killed him,

848
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:19,534
his debt rolls over to you.

849
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:24,404
I didn't kill Lucius.

850
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:27,441
He's alive.
He just called me.

851
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:30,878
Yeah, well, I doubt that,

852
00:53:30,912 --> 00:53:32,412
'cause we just seen him.

853
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:35,248
He's dead as a doornail.

854
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:37,284
- But--
- But, but, but, but, but...

855
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:40,253
Save your buts, Princess.

856
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:42,790
We saw you driving away.
How you think we found you?

857
00:53:44,324 --> 00:53:45,425
How much you gettin'?

858
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:51,032
Fifty thousand.

859
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:54,267
Fifty thousand dollars.

860
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:56,771
Well, Lucius, he owed me ten.

861
00:53:56,804 --> 00:54:00,373
What, with interest and all,
carry the one divided by two...

862
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:02,275
20k should do it.

863
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,645
Twenty thousand?

864
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:05,947
By tomorrow.

865
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,549
That's impossible.

866
00:54:09,884 --> 00:54:13,921
See, Mace, the wicked
are stubborn and selfish.

867
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:15,455
Do your thing.

868
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,492
- No, no, no--
- Mace!

869
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,528
What are you doing?

870
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:23,396
She's a waitress, dummy.

871
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,966
She's on her feet
all day long.

872
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:27,034
You cut off her toe,
she's going be hobbling around

873
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:28,770
like a three-legged dog.

874
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:33,641
You right or left-handed?

875
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:35,576
None of your damn business.

876
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,412
Well, it's a known fact
that 90 percent of human beings

877
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,682
are right-handed, so...

878
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,951
No! No, no, no, no!

879
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:44,819
Please, please, please.

880
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:46,319
No, no, no!

881
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:48,321
Please, please, stop--
I have the money.

882
00:54:48,355 --> 00:54:50,591
I'll get you the money.
Stop, please. Stop him!

883
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,026
Okay, all right.

884
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:57,064
I'm not a man completely
devoid of compassion.

885
00:54:57,098 --> 00:54:59,499
You can keep your finger.

886
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:00,433
For now.

887
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:03,771
But if I don't get my money
in two days,

888
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:07,108
that little piggy right there,
it's gonna go "Wee, wee, wee,"

889
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:09,076
all the way to the butcher shop.

890
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:15,315
Time's up.

891
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:27,628
This is Russ.

892
00:55:27,662 --> 00:55:29,664
What you doing for supper?

893
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,098
I don't have any plans.

894
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:33,067
Why don't you
come out to the house?

895
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,102
I'll throw a couple of steaks
on the grill.

896
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,605
Thurmond, is there something
you want to talk to me about?

897
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:41,943
I got some information
you might be interested in.

898
00:55:41,976 --> 00:55:45,546
And I haven't been the kindest
person to you lately.

899
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,714
Okay, what time?

900
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:49,550
I eat early. Five?

901
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:50,651
Okay.

902
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:52,820
I'll be there.

903
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:04,031
Come in.

904
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,136
I just came by
to pick up a few things.

905
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,806
Well, shit, come in and sit down
and we'll have a drink.

906
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,875
Come on.

907
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:20,948
How is, uh, Horace doing?

908
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:23,551
- He is hanging in.
- Yeah?

909
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:26,554
Just the medical bills
that are killing us.

910
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:30,423
Well, I want to know that
I've been thinking about you.

911
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:32,492
And I'm gonna come up
with something, okay.

912
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:34,461
Oh, I appreciate that.

913
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,864
Shit.

914
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,168
Cheers.

915
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,506
It was a damn good steak,
Thurmond.

916
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:50,144
- Not much of a cook.
- Mm.

917
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:52,780
But I can grill
with the best of 'em.

918
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:54,548
So how long have you
been here now?

919
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:57,118
Um, going on seven years.

920
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,452
Oh.

921
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:03,157
After my wife died,
I decided to build
my dream home.

922
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,893
I don't know why the hell
I waited so long.

923
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,663
What about you?

924
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:10,932
How come you never married?

925
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:12,700
Shit, I got close once.

926
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:13,801
What about Delaine?

927
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:15,903
I mean, she's fine.
We're friends.

928
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:19,472
And you're telling me
that you two never...

929
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:21,776
I mean,
being neighbors and all.

930
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:22,877
We're not that neighborly.

931
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,845
Okay, okay.

932
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:26,814
Excuse me for prying.

933
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:29,951
Just habit of the job.

934
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:33,054
So what's the, uh, information
you wanted to talk to me about?

935
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:34,055
Oh, yeah.

936
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:37,658
Take a look at this.

937
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:44,732
Lucius McFalls.

938
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:45,866
Bad dude.

939
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:47,802
You know that guy?

940
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:50,571
No, I don't know him,

941
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:51,706
but I saw him the other day.

942
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:53,808
Where?

943
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:55,543
Over at Delaine's house,

944
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:58,145
he was helping her
move her Daddy's shit out.

945
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:00,548
I mean, he's got
a hell of a rap sheet.

946
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,482
- Well--
- Petty stuff, but...

947
00:58:03,718 --> 00:58:05,820
still, it's just
not the kind of person

948
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:07,989
I would think Delaine
would be hanging around.

949
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:09,857
Well, obviously, I'll tell her.

950
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,094
No, don't... tell her about it.

951
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:13,995
Why not?

952
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,497
Well, I shouldn't be
telling you this, but...

953
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:21,669
What the hell, I think
you have a right to know.

954
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:25,206
You're being used.

955
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:29,844
Whenever there's a murder,
we ask,

956
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,812
"Who stands to gain from it?"

957
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:34,815
Who stands to gain
from Carl's death?

958
00:58:36,217 --> 00:58:37,918
I don't know.

959
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:39,854
Delaine, of course.

960
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:42,156
Why?

961
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,858
Life insurance.

962
00:58:45,693 --> 00:58:50,197
Delaine stands to get
over $500,000.

963
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:55,336
So... I don't--
I'm not following.

964
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:56,871
What are you saying, Thurmond?

965
00:58:58,272 --> 00:59:00,641
I'm saying I believe

966
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:04,245
that Delaine and hired Lucius
to kill Carl,

967
00:59:04,278 --> 00:59:07,048
make it look like you were
the original target.

968
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:10,117
The old wrong house,
wrong victim thing.

969
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:12,286
Yeah, that's-that's crazy.

970
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,654
I'm the one that brought it up.

971
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:17,291
Played right into their hands.

972
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:19,693
I bet Lucius
is the one calling you.

973
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:22,329
Hm.

974
00:59:24,131 --> 00:59:28,636
Lucius was seen
driving on your street at 10:13.

975
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,305
It puts him right there.

976
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:32,973
Some shit.

977
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:35,810
To top it off,

978
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:38,345
Delaine and Carl
are in a shit load of debt.

979
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:41,082
Online betting.

980
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:45,086
They were about to
lose the house.

981
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,289
So she's been
borrowing money from Dewey

982
00:59:48,322 --> 00:59:51,225
and then working extra shifts
to pay him off.

983
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,761
Thurmond, who else
knows about this?

984
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:55,262
Nobody.

985
00:59:55,296 --> 00:59:58,199
Like I told you,
I shouldn't be telling you.

986
00:59:58,232 --> 01:00:01,735
But I wanted to confirm
a couple of things.

987
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:05,940
And I... I think you
have a right to know.

988
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:07,308
Well, I appreciate it.

989
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:09,076
I really do.
Thank you.

990
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:12,113
Now, not a word to Delaine.
Okay?

991
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:14,882
Not a word.
I promise.

992
01:01:49,476 --> 01:01:51,011
Hey, sorry I'm late.

993
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:55,883
You okay?

994
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:58,385
Yeah, I'm just glad you're home.

995
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:05,025
I'm here now.

996
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,228
What's going on?

997
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:13,867
Russ, I can't thank you enough
for how you've taken care of me
since Daddy died.

998
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,336
Well, listen,
I'm happy to help.

999
01:02:17,171 --> 01:02:18,739
I would've done
anything for you.

1000
01:02:20,207 --> 01:02:22,910
Okay, Russ, there's something
I gotta tell you.

1001
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:25,012
Okay, I'm listening.

1002
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:30,851
I just... I don't know
how you're going to take this.

1003
01:02:32,386 --> 01:02:35,523
I think I could
use a beer first.

1004
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:38,125
Cool, you know where
the fridge is, right?

1005
01:02:38,158 --> 01:02:40,361
- Grab me one, too,
while you're at it.
- Okay.

1006
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,018
You get lost?

1007
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:47,161
So, there's something
you wanted to tell me.

1008
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:50,331
Tell me about your day first.

1009
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:52,199
I mean, it was good.

1010
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:54,368
I went over to Thurmond's,
we had steaks,

1011
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:57,639
and he updated me
about the investigation, so...

1012
01:03:57,672 --> 01:04:01,408
You? I'm the one
he should be updating.

1013
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:03,578
Well, I think he was
gonna fill you in tomorrow,

1014
01:04:03,611 --> 01:04:06,947
but, uh, he won't be
doing that anymore.

1015
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,415
Why not?

1016
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:11,051
Well, I shot him.

1017
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,488
What?

1018
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:16,957
Yeah, he's dead, Delaine.
I shot him.

1019
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:19,026
Why?

1020
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,562
Old Thurmond
was a little smarter

1021
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:22,162
than I gave him credit for.

1022
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:24,365
He knew everything, Delaine.

1023
01:04:24,398 --> 01:04:27,267
Well, not everything.
I, mean he didn't know that I...

1024
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,203
I knew everything, too.

1025
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:30,904
I owe people money.

1026
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:32,574
And they won't wait,
so I can't wait.

1027
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:34,642
Look, the insurance company
will pay out

1028
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:37,277
as soon as the sheriff
wraps up his investigation.

1029
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:39,146
The money'll be here any day.

1030
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:43,317
Yeah.

1031
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,952
Aren't I the fool?

1032
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:50,224
And to think that I suggested
the wrong house,

1033
01:04:50,257 --> 01:04:52,359
the wrong victim theory
to Thurmond.

1034
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:55,295
You don't know
the whole story.

1035
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,398
Oh, yeah?

1036
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:00,167
What don't I know, Delaine?

1037
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,168
Tell me.

1038
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:02,236
First, why don't you tell me

1039
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:04,438
what Lucius
is doing in your trunk?

1040
01:05:04,471 --> 01:05:06,273
Well, he's protecting us.

1041
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,610
No body, no crime.

1042
01:05:09,611 --> 01:05:11,646
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

1043
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:15,449
You see, you and I,

1044
01:05:15,482 --> 01:05:18,318
we're going to split
the insurance money.

1045
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:21,155
What people don't understand
is I lost a lot of money

1046
01:05:21,188 --> 01:05:22,724
when the merger
didn't go through.

1047
01:05:22,757 --> 01:05:24,958
I'm about to
lose my business.

1048
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,094
I don't understand.

1049
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:29,329
I was with you

1050
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:31,699
when I got one of them calls
from Lucius.

1051
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:35,068
- Yeah.
- How do you explain that?

1052
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:36,036
Pernie.

1053
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:39,173
Yeah. I gave her the recording.

1054
01:05:40,508 --> 01:05:44,077
And you did exactly
what I thought you would do.

1055
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:46,681
You see, Pernie,
she's broke, too.

1056
01:05:46,714 --> 01:05:48,583
So when I told her
about my little plan,

1057
01:05:48,616 --> 01:05:50,752
she, you know,
was eager to help out

1058
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:54,221
for a...
a small cut, of course.

1059
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,158
Lord have mercy.

1060
01:05:58,192 --> 01:06:00,327
So, Delaine,

1061
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,630
once again, what don't I know?

1062
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:07,401
This wasn't my idea.

1063
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:13,373
It was Daddy's, his-his cancer
came back stage four.

1064
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:15,375
So that's why you killed him?

1065
01:06:16,544 --> 01:06:18,111
He was gonna commit suicide,

1066
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:20,782
but then I wouldn't get
any insurance money.

1067
01:06:20,815 --> 01:06:23,250
We're in debt
from his gambling habit.

1068
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:25,018
About to lose the house.

1069
01:06:28,188 --> 01:06:33,695
Russ... I didn't know you then
like I know you now.

1070
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,296
If I did, I never would've
gone through with this.

1071
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:40,668
I never meant you no harm.

1072
01:06:40,702 --> 01:06:43,403
Do you expect me
to believe that shit?

1073
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:47,307
It's the God to honest truth.

1074
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,077
Delaine, you killed your--

1075
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:55,182
We could have made
a go of this.

1076
01:06:55,215 --> 01:06:58,218
I was falling in love
with you, Russ.

1077
01:06:58,252 --> 01:07:00,722
I really was.

1078
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:02,790
If you woulda only
minded your own business.

1079
01:07:03,858 --> 01:07:06,260
But money is money.

1080
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:09,329
And if you interfere again,
I will kill you.

1081
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:13,133
I'm leaving now.

1082
01:10:22,355 --> 01:10:24,257
Hey, hey, it's okay.

1083
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,527
Hey, shh.

1084
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:28,930
Listen, everything's gonna be
okay, all right.

1085
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:30,397
We'll just split the money.
Okay?

1086
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:57,752
I'm sorry, I can't lie.

1087
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,940
<i>Try as you might,</i>

1088
01:12:18,973 --> 01:12:22,143
<i>you can't escape His</i>
<i>all-seeing gaze.</i>

1089
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:25,546
<i>Do you think He who</i>
<i>made the eye, doesn't see?</i>

1090
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,749
<i>Do you think He who</i>
<i>made the ear, doesn't hear?</i>

1091
01:12:28,783 --> 01:12:32,153
<i>Do you think He who</i>
<i>judges the nations,</i>
<i>doesn't punish?</i>

1092
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:35,422
<i>He knows all</i>
<i>and will reward the righteous</i>

1093
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:37,959
<i>according to</i>
<i>their good deeds.</i>

1094
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:41,829
<i>But the wicked, oh, the wicked.</i>

1095
01:12:41,863 --> 01:12:44,098
<i>He will punish</i>
<i>in eternal hellfire</i>

1096
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:46,534
<i>that was created for</i>
<i>the devil and his angels.</i>

1097
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:50,972
<i>So, beware my friends,</i>
<i>your sins will find you out.</i>

1098
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:55,176
<i>Maybe not today,</i>
<i>maybe not tomorrow, but soon.</i>

1099
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:57,144
Oh, shut the hell up.

1100
01:13:16,597 --> 01:13:17,999
Hard to believe, ain't it?

1101
01:13:18,032 --> 01:13:18,933
Surely is.

1102
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:20,902
Sheriff filed a murder

1103
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:23,170
and another body
dragged from the reservoir.

1104
01:13:23,204 --> 01:13:25,206
Sure is some meanness
in this world.

1105
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:26,707
Amen to that.

1106
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,016
Tillman, what'll you have?

1107
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,617
You got a minute?

1108
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:37,818
Just about.

1109
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,489
That is one heck of a shiner
you got on your head.

1110
01:13:44,725 --> 01:13:46,994
You know the last time there was
a murder in this county?

1111
01:13:48,896 --> 01:13:52,099
- Nearly 30 years ago.
- Okay.

1112
01:13:52,133 --> 01:13:56,537
Okay, so now there's been
three murders in just a few
days.

1113
01:14:00,675 --> 01:14:02,510
Hold on. Gotta take this.

1114
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:05,146
Yeah?

1115
01:14:08,249 --> 01:14:09,617
Is that right?

1116
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:12,720
When was this?

1117
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:14,487
I'll be there directly.

1118
01:14:17,658 --> 01:14:20,528
Make that four murders.

1119
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:23,097
Russ Potter's body
was just found in the reservoir.

1120
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,465
Not far from Lucius McFalls.

1121
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,902
No, that's not--

1122
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:28,903
That's not possible.

1123
01:14:28,936 --> 01:14:30,638
I just saw him the other night.

1124
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:32,740
You know what all four
have in common?

1125
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:35,076
You.

1126
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,611
What are you saying?

1127
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:39,947
Oh, see, there's your daddy.

1128
01:14:39,981 --> 01:14:42,016
Russ Potter
was-was your neighbor.

1129
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:44,018
You worked with Lucius McFalls.

1130
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,654
And Sheriff Fowler,

1131
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,056
he was investigating
your daddy's killing

1132
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:52,626
at the same time
as his murder.

1133
01:14:53,627 --> 01:14:55,262
Don't that strike you odd?

1134
01:14:56,831 --> 01:14:59,233
Kane, your mind is perverted.

1135
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:04,271
I'm not gonna sit here
and take the slanderous attacks
on my character.

1136
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:06,107
If you'll excuse me,

1137
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,643
Miss Betty over at table seven
needs her check.

1138
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:11,278
Hey, hey, just one more thing.

1139
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:15,750
Now, how come you drove
Russ Potter's car

1140
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:16,951
to work this morning?

1141
01:15:16,984 --> 01:15:18,753
He let me borrow it.

1142
01:15:18,786 --> 01:15:19,887
And where's your car?

1143
01:15:21,789 --> 01:15:22,990
It got stolen.

1144
01:15:23,024 --> 01:15:24,625
Did you report it missing?

1145
01:15:24,658 --> 01:15:26,260
I'm reporting it now.

1146
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:28,929
Excuse me.

1147
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:35,603
Miss Betty.
Here you go.

1148
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:37,271
- Delaine!
- Comin'.

1149
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:38,873
It's for you.

1150
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:40,708
Now, you know I don't
like personal calls.

1151
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:42,777
Make it quick, please.

1152
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:45,913
Hello?

1153
01:15:45,946 --> 01:15:47,181
<i>Where will you be</i>

1154
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:49,683
<i>the minute you wake up dead?</i>

1155
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:52,920
- Who is this?
<i>- Oh, who do you think?</i>

1156
01:15:52,953 --> 01:15:57,058
- What do you want?
- You're a bright girl,
figure it out.

1157
01:15:57,091 --> 01:16:01,095
<i>-</i> How much?
<i>- Well, half sounds good.</i>

1158
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:03,030
I wasn't gonna be so greedy,

1159
01:16:03,064 --> 01:16:04,932
<i>but since you put me</i>
<i>out of work</i>

1160
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:08,669
<i>and jobs for women my age</i>
<i>aren't all that plentiful,</i>

1161
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:11,038
<i>I think I deserve to be greedy.</i>

1162
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:12,640
Yeah, well,
I ain't got the money yet.

1163
01:16:12,673 --> 01:16:14,842
Oh, I know that.

1164
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:18,012
But when you do,
don't forget about old Pernie.

1165
01:16:18,045 --> 01:16:20,881
Old Pernie knows everything.

1166
01:16:20,915 --> 01:16:23,918
<i>And don't think you</i>
<i>can get rid of me</i>
<i>like you did the others.</i>

1167
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:27,088
The minute you
step foot on my property,

1168
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:30,191
you'll be dead before
the other foot hits the ground.

1169
01:16:30,224 --> 01:16:32,760
And turn your cell phone on.

1170
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:35,162
Pernie don't like being ignored.

1171
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:51,178
You sure work a lot.

1172
01:16:51,212 --> 01:16:53,280
Yeah, well,
I got bills to pay.

1173
01:16:53,314 --> 01:16:56,250
Well, I would pray that
I'm on the top of that list,

1174
01:16:57,151 --> 01:16:58,652
We got a problem.

1175
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:02,756
We got a problem, huh?
What is our problem?

1176
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:03,757
Pernie.

1177
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,693
What's a Pernie?

1178
01:17:05,726 --> 01:17:07,962
Oh, Pernie's not a what,
she's a who.

1179
01:17:07,995 --> 01:17:09,964
And so why is she our problem?

1180
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:14,068
Because she knows everything.
And she wants a big cut,

1181
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:16,237
and if she don't get it,
she's gonna go to the police.

1182
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:21,909
And if she does, I go to jail,
which means no insurance money.

1183
01:17:21,942 --> 01:17:23,911
Well, I still don't see
how she's our problem.

1184
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:24,845
She's your problem.

1185
01:17:24,879 --> 01:17:26,881
She wants a cut,
give her a cut of your cut.

1186
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:28,816
Nice upgrade, by the way.

1187
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:32,453
When I say she wants a cut,
she wants all of it.

1188
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,988
She's blackmailing me.

1189
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:39,059
What'd you have in mind?

1190
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:02,476
Ain't nobody here.

1191
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,378
Maybe we got the wrong house.

1192
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,981
No, we got the right house.

1193
01:19:07,014 --> 01:19:09,083
This is the address
Delaine gave me.

1194
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:11,919
Maybe they're out for supper.

1195
01:19:11,952 --> 01:19:13,187
At midnight?

1196
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,089
Use your goddamn brain.

1197
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:18,158
Something ain't right.

1198
01:19:29,103 --> 01:19:31,338
What... the...?

1199
01:19:31,372 --> 01:19:33,240
You remember to get gas?

1200
01:19:33,274 --> 01:19:35,476
- Well, yeah.
- Well, then why
ain't she starting?

1201
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:37,311
Uh, I don't know.

1202
01:19:38,345 --> 01:19:39,413
Go check under the hood.

1203
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:40,881
What for?

1204
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:44,251
'Cause that's where
the engine is, dumbass.

1205
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:02,803
Battery ain't connected.

1206
01:20:17,084 --> 01:20:18,152
Get out of the car!

1207
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:19,286
Hey, you.

1208
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:32,333
Nice work.

1209
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:34,569
Cancer ain't got me yet.

1210
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:37,237
Yeah.

1211
01:20:37,271 --> 01:20:39,206
- <i>It's done.</i>
- Are you sure?

1212
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:43,944
I said it's done.
And thanks for the tip.

1213
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:47,348
Even if it was you
who sent 'em my way
in the first place.

1214
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:49,651
And how do I know it's done?

1215
01:20:49,684 --> 01:20:54,188
Oh, trust me.
Those boys won't be
seeing their mamas no more.

1216
01:20:55,557 --> 01:20:59,226
Now, it's just the two of us.

1217
01:20:59,259 --> 01:21:02,329
<i>You be sure to let me know</i>
<i>when that check comes in.</i>

1218
01:21:02,363 --> 01:21:06,100
Remember,
old Pernie knows everything.

1219
01:21:06,133 --> 01:21:08,135
So you keep sayin'.

1220
01:21:08,168 --> 01:21:11,238
Just don't want you to forget.

1221
01:21:11,271 --> 01:21:13,941
I gotta go.
Customers are waiting.

1222
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:03,323
What the devil?

1223
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:11,165
Oh, girl,
you should know better
than to mess with old Pernie!

1224
01:22:15,502 --> 01:22:17,004
Whoo.

1225
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:22,176
How do you like that,
you old bitch?

1226
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:06,487
<i>We got a 10-50</i>
<i>on Davis Crossing Road</i>

1227
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:08,355
<i>at the entrance of...</i>

1228
01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:10,491
<i>Got a 10-79 female.</i>

1229
01:23:10,525 --> 01:23:12,192
Ten-four, en route.

1230
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,146
What's going on?

1231
01:23:41,823 --> 01:23:43,423
Ah, shit.

1232
01:23:50,632 --> 01:23:51,766
<i>Where are you?</i>

1233
01:23:51,799 --> 01:23:53,400
Dewey, Dew--

1234
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:55,402
Dewey, I'll be there
in a few minutes.

1235
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:56,704
Well, you just
need to get here.

1236
01:23:56,738 --> 01:23:58,305
Okay, the lunch rush
don't even start

1237
01:23:58,338 --> 01:23:59,807
for another good half hour,
okay.

1238
01:23:59,841 --> 01:24:01,709
And I'm gonna need you
to work double shift, too.

1239
01:24:01,743 --> 01:24:04,579
Okay. Yes, I will work
the supper shift, too.

1240
01:24:04,612 --> 01:24:06,514
Okay. Bye.

1241
01:24:07,682 --> 01:24:09,216
Bleeding Christ.

1242
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:22,830
Delaine.

1243
01:24:22,864 --> 01:24:25,800
- Tillman.
- We have a warrant
for your arrest.

1244
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:29,704
Arrest?
What charge?

1245
01:24:29,737 --> 01:24:31,806
You're under arrest for
the murders of Carl Moore,

1246
01:24:31,839 --> 01:24:35,142
Russ Potter, Lucius McFalls,
and Pernie Cannon.

1247
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:37,277
Now, you have the right
to remain silent.

1248
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:41,415
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in the court of law.

1249
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:42,750
You have the right to attorney.

1250
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:44,151
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

1251
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:46,654
one will be appointed to you.

1252
01:24:46,688 --> 01:24:48,756
Do you understand
these rights I've said to you?

1253
01:24:49,657 --> 01:24:50,825
Sure.

1254
01:24:57,832 --> 01:24:59,132
Thank you.

1255
01:25:04,806 --> 01:25:06,139
Mm.

1256
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,209
Y'all don't understand.

1257
01:25:09,242 --> 01:25:11,378
Understand what?

1258
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:13,681
Well, I was only doing
what come natural.

1259
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:16,684
Ain't greed natural?

1260
01:25:17,785 --> 01:25:20,855
How can you or God blame me?

1261
01:25:20,888 --> 01:25:22,590
You broke the law.

1262
01:25:22,624 --> 01:25:24,626
The law.

1263
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:28,796
Oh, okay. So I'm a sinner
because I broke the law?

1264
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:33,668
Mm. Or did I break the law

1265
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:36,169
because I'm a sinner?

1266
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:37,672
What does it matter?

1267
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:43,911
Well, it matters
'cause if I knew the answer,

1268
01:25:43,945 --> 01:25:46,614
I'd be free.

1269
01:25:46,648 --> 01:25:49,416
Yeah, I don't... I don't know
about any of that, but...

1270
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:52,854
I suggest you stop talking.

1271
01:25:58,559 --> 01:26:00,528
All right. Let's go.

1272
01:26:12,674 --> 01:26:15,342
<i>It's a funny question to ask.</i>

1273
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,477
<i>"Where are you after you die?"</i>

1274
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,449
<i>For me, it's not</i>
<i>an altogether unpleasant place,</i>

1275
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:24,819
<i>but I can't speak for</i>
<i>other souls.</i>

1276
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:28,990
<i>And I do sense that if</i>
<i>the totality of your actions</i>

1277
01:26:29,023 --> 01:26:30,992
<i>are more good than bad,</i>

1278
01:26:31,025 --> 01:26:34,729
<i>you end up on the right side</i>
<i>of your maker.</i>

1279
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:38,633
<i>For those who tip the scales</i>
<i>the other way,</i>

1280
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:43,004
<i>well,</i>
<i>as the radio preacher says,</i>

1281
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:45,807
<i>"Hell is hell."</i>
